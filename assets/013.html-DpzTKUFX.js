Although Oscar was proud that Jerome admitted being influenced by him, Sylvia didn’t like Jerome’s work at all. She said it was shockingly terrible and unoriginal. It’s likely that she criticized the painting style, the lack of originality, and maybe even mentioned Oscar as the source of those bad ideas.</p><p>我认为艺术评论人西尔维娅写了一篇非常负面的评论。虽然奥斯卡因为杰罗姆承认受到他影响而感到自豪，但西尔维娅根本不喜欢杰罗姆的作品。她说这些画“糟糕得令人震惊，毫无原创性”。她很可能批评了他的绘画风格、缺乏创意，甚至可能提到奥斯卡是那些糟糕点子的来源。</p><ul><li>originality: 英 /ə,rɪdʒɪ&#39;nælɪtɪ/ 美 /ə&#39;rɪdʒə&#39;næləti/ <ul><li>n. 独创性;创造性</li></ul></li></ul>',25)]))}const h=e(s,[["render",a]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/S/013.html","title":"Stolen Art - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Stolen Art - B2 Oscar is attending an exclusive art show featuring Jerome Gale, his former student.
