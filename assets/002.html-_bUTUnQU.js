It was clogged, <strong>and</strong> I tried using some chemicals to <strong>clear</strong> it. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn’t. One time, it didn’t work at all, so I added more chemicals. It took me several days, but I finally managed to unclog it.</p><p>是的，我以前确实需要修理过水槽。水槽堵了，我尝试用一些化学剂疏通。有时候管用，有时候不行。有一次完全没效果，我又加了更多化学剂，花了好几天才终于把它疏通。</p><hr><p>Yes, I’ve had to repair a drain before. At the time, I was living in an apartment where the <strong>drainage system</strong> would get clogged from time to time. My washing machine didn’t have a <strong>proper filter</strong>, so after each wash, a lot of debris — including hair — would go straight into the drain. This made it very easy for the pipes to get blocked.</p><p>To prevent this, I often used chemical drain cleaners to keep the pipes clear. However, one time the clog was particularly severe. I first tried to clear it using a pressure-based tool, but the pipe had a U-shaped section connected to both the washing machine and the bathroom sink, so I couldn’t create a sealed pressure system.</p><p>As a result, I had no choice but to use chemical cleaner. At first, I didn’t use enough, so it didn’t work. Then I used too much, which caused the chemicals to crystallize inside the pipe. It ended up taking me several days to slowly dissolve the blockage and fully unclog the drain.</p><p>是的，我曾经修理过下水管道。当时我住在一间公寓中，下水管道时不时会堵。我的洗衣机没有过滤功能，所以洗衣服后的杂质——包括一些头发——都直接流入下水道中，这非常容易导致管道堵塞。</p><p>为了预防这种情况，我经常使用化学管道清洁剂来清理管道。不过有一次堵得特别严重。我一开始尝试用带气压的工具来通管道，但那段管道是 U 形的，一头连着洗衣机，一头连着洗脸盆，所以无法形成密闭的压力环境。</p><p>结果我只能用化学清洁剂来处理。一开始剂量不够，没有疏通成功，后来用得太多，导致清洁剂在管道里结晶了。最后我花了好几天才慢慢把堵塞物溶解并完全疏通管道。</p>',27)]))}const g=e(n,[["render",r]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/I/002.html","title":"I Can Fix It!","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"I Can Fix It!
