Maybe you&#39;ll stop yawning if you have a coffee. But the thing is, yawning is good for you! Here&#39;s my advice:</p><p><strong>Yawn to Relax</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, yawning helps relax your muscles! When you yawn, your muscles get a little stretch. It feels nice, right? So, don&#39;t hide your yawns. Let them out and enjoy the stretch.</p><p><strong>Breathe and Be Happy</strong></p><p>Yawning brings more air to your lungs, which is a good thing! It helps you feel more awake. Breathing fresh air might be better, but yawning works too. Maybe next time you&#39;re tired, try yawning a few times.</p><p><strong>Yawning is Contagious Fun</strong></p><p>Have you noticed that when someone yawns, you start yawning too? It&#39;s a funny thing! Yawning is like a game everyone plays without thinking. So, if you yawn, you might just make someone else yawn, too. Spread the yawning joy!</p><p>So, the next time you yawn, remember that it&#39;s helpful. Your muscles will thank you, and you might even help a friend yawn, too!</p><p>Remember: Don&#39;t work too much!</p><p>Lin</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><h2 id="style" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#style"><span>Style</span></a></h2><ol><li>&quot;you&#39;ll stop yawning if you have a coffee&quot; <ol><li>Correction: you&#39;ll stop yawning if you have some coffee</li><li>🔍 Issue: “a coffee” is informal/slang in some dialects, but “<strong>some coffee</strong>” is more standard in writing.</li></ol></li><li>&quot;maybe better, but yawning works too&quot; <ol><li>Correction: might be better, but yawning works too</li><li>🔍 Issue: The original says “Breathing fresh air might be better” earlier, so this repeat should be consistent — not “maybe better.”</li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>What part of yawning surprised you most?</strong></p><p>What surprised me the most was learning that yawning is not just a sign of being tired, but it can actually help us become more <strong>alert</strong> and even <strong>improve our mood</strong>. I was especially surprised when Lin mentioned that yawning helps people wake up and feel happier. Before reading the article, I always thought yawning only happened when we were exhausted. I didn’t realize it had such a positive and useful function. This really changed the way I see something so ordinary.</p><p>最让我惊讶的是，了解到打哈欠不仅仅是疲劳的表现，它实际上还能帮助我们更清醒，甚至提升情绪。我尤其惊讶 Lin 提到打哈欠有助于人们醒来并感到更快乐。读这篇文章之前，我总以为打哈欠只是因为累了。我没想到它竟然有这么积极而有用的功能。这真的改变了我对这个日常行为的看法。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What part of yawning surprised you most?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I was surprised/ What surprised me/ I didn&#39;t know that</p><p>I was surprised when Lin said <strong>that</strong> yawning will help people <strong>wake up</strong> and be happy.
