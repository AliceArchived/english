I find this advice quite amusing because, in real life, such behavior often has the opposite effect. Rather than earning <strong>genuine respect</strong>, it might come across as <strong>arrogant</strong> or <strong>attention-seeking</strong>. Especially if you&#39;re not well known, showing off could actually make people try to take advantage of you instead of respecting you.</p><p>我认为最有趣的部分是奥斯卡建议说，如果你想获得别人的尊重，就应该穿鲜艳的衣服，并不断谈论自己的成就。我觉得这个建议很可笑，因为在现实生活中，这种行为往往会适得其反。与其说赢得真正的尊重，不如说更可能被人认为是自大或爱出风头。特别是当你并不出名时，炫耀反而可能让人想要利用你，而不是尊重你。</p><hr><p>I think the funniest part is when Oscar says, “If you want people to respect you, you need to wear colorful clothes and tell everyone your achievements.” In my opinion, that idea is completely misguided. Respect isn&#39;t something you gain by showing off; in fact, doing so might attract the wrong kind of attention. If you&#39;re not a celebrity, people might try to take advantage of you, pretending to be friendly just to benefit from your reputation or resources.</p><p>我认为最有趣的部分是奥斯卡说：“如果你想让别人尊重你，你需要穿五颜六色的衣服，并告诉大家你的成就。”在我看来，这种想法完全是误导。尊重不是靠炫耀得来的，实际上，这样做反而可能吸引到不良的关注。如果你不是名人，人们可能会假装对你友好，只是为了从你的名声或资源中获利。</p><hr><p>I think the funniest part is when Oscar says, “Wear bright clothes. Tell everyone about your achievements. That’s how to earn respect.” To me, this advice is quite ironic and misguided. True respect doesn&#39;t come from appearance or self-promotion — in fact, doing that might make people think you&#39;re arrogant or trying too hard. Especially if you&#39;re not well known, others might approach you with selfish motives, trying to exploit you rather than genuinely respecting you.</p><p>我认为最有趣的部分是奥斯卡说：“穿亮色衣服，把你的成就告诉所有人。那才是赢得尊重的方法。”在我看来，这种建议非常讽刺，也很误导。真正的尊重不是靠外表或自我吹嘘得来的。事实上，这样反而会让人觉得你自大或刻意讨好。尤其是当你并不出名时，别人可能只是出于私利接近你，而不是真心尊重你。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which of Oscar&#39;s tips do you find funniest?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phreses: I think/ The funniest part/ In my opinioin</p><p>I think the funniest part is Oscar <strong>saying</strong>, &quot;if you want people to respect you, you need to wear colorful clothes and tell everyone your achievements.&quot; In my opinion, that&#39;s a big mistake.
