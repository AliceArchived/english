Why or why not?</strong></p><p>I think these new rules are reasonable. The kitchen should only allow staff in, so it is easy to ensure food quality and safety. The store is a business, so just buy a small thing and use the facility all day is not good and also affects other customers to use them.</p><blockquote><ol><li><strong>“so it is easy”</strong> → 更自然为 <strong>“so it is easier”</strong>（表达“更容易”确保质量）</li><li><strong>“just buy a small thing and use the facility all day”</strong> → 句式不清晰，应改为 <strong>“buying just one small item and then using the facilities all day”</strong>（名词化结构更通顺）</li><li><strong>“is not good and also affects other customers to use them”</strong> → 不符合英语表达习惯，应为：<br> → <strong>“is not appropriate, and it also affects other customers’ ability to use them”</strong><ol><li><strong>“affect someone’s ability to do something”</strong> 是<strong>语法正确</strong>、<strong>逻辑严密</strong>，而且在英语中<strong>非常常用</strong>的表达结构。</li></ol></li></ol></blockquote><p>I think these new rules are reasonable. The <strong>kitchen</strong> should be <strong>restricted to</strong> staff only, so it is <strong>easier</strong> to ensure food quality and safety. The store is a business, so buying just <strong>one small item</strong> and then using the <strong>facilities</strong> all day is not <strong>appropriate</strong> — it also prevents other customers from using them.**.</p><p>我认为这些新规定是合理的。厨房应该只允许员工进入，这样更容易保证食品的质量与安全。商店毕竟是做生意的，只买一件小东西却整天使用店内设施是不合适的，而且也会影响其他顾客使用。</p><table><thead><tr><th>句子</th><th>中文解释</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The noise affected my <strong>ability to concentrate</strong>.</td><td>噪音影响了我<strong>集中注意力的能力</strong>。</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of sleep affects your <strong>ability to make decisions</strong>.</td><td>睡眠不足会影响你<strong>做决定的能力</strong>。</td></tr><tr><td>The slow internet affected students’ <strong>ability to finish the test on time</strong>.</td><td>网络太慢影响了学生<strong>按时完成考试的能力</strong>。</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>职场英语 / 报告写作</strong>：&quot;The new policy may affect employees’ <strong>ability</strong> to complete tasks efficiently.&quot;</p><p><strong>学术论文</strong>：&quot;Anxiety can negatively impact a student’s <strong>ability</strong> to retain information.&quot;</p><p><strong>日常表达</strong>：&quot;Heavy traffic affects my <strong>ability</strong> to get to work on time.&quot;</p><p>在原句中的使用是完全标准的：</p><blockquote><p><strong>It also affects other customers’ ability to use the facilities.</strong><br> = 影响了其他顾客使用这些设施的能力/机会。</p></blockquote><p>在这里，“ability” 并不等同于生理能力，而是指“可使用的权利、条件或可达性（accessibility）”。它符合英文表达<strong>含蓄、逻辑准确</strong>的风格。</p><p>如果换成中文类比理解：</p><ul><li>中文可能说：“影响了其他顾客使用这些设施的<strong>机会</strong>”</li><li>英文中不会说 “affect others to use”，而是说：<br> → “affect others’ <strong>ability to use</strong>”</li></ul><p><strong>“It also affects other customers’ ability to use them.”</strong></p><p>这里的 <strong>“ability”</strong> 并不强调身体能力，而是表示**“可使用的机会、权利或条件”<strong>。这在英文中非常常见，用于表达因为某些人占用资源，导致</strong>他人失去使用这些资源的机会**。</p><p>什么不用 “affects other customers to use them”?</p><p>因为 <strong>“affect + someone + to do something”</strong> 是不符合英语语法结构的。</p><p>举个例子：</p><ul><li>❌ <em>The noise affected me to sleep.</em> → 不对</li><li>✅ <em>The noise affected my ability to sleep.</em> → 正确 ✔️</li></ul><p>这是因为 <strong>“affect”</strong> 后面不能直接加动词不定式（to do），而应该加一个<strong>名词结构</strong>，如：</p><ul><li><strong>affect health</strong></li><li><strong>affect performance</strong></li><li><strong>affect ability to concentrate</strong></li><li><strong>affect the ability to access public resources</strong></li></ul><h3 id="所以这句话为什么用-ability-是正确的" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#所以这句话为什么用-ability-是正确的"><span>所以这句话为什么用 “ability” 是正确的：</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>They buy one small item and use the facilities all day.</strong><br> → <strong>This affects other customers’ ability to use them.</strong></li></ul><p>✔ 这里的“ability”表示的是：<br><strong>其他顾客原本可以使用这些设施的机会或权利被影响了。</strong></p><hr><p>I think <s>it is</s> reasonable policies.
