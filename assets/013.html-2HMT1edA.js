This is what I have today:</p><p><strong>Old Gum Collection - 2 dollars</strong></p><p>Yes, you heard right — an old gum collection! I found these under my bed. I can&#39;t believe they were there for so long. I think they&#39;re older than me! If you&#39;re an artist, you can use them for a sculpture. Or, make a wish and chew some &quot;vintage&quot; gum!</p><p><strong>Burnt Microwave - Free</strong></p><p>Before you ask, no, it wasn&#39;t me who burnt this microwave! There must be a secret cooking method I don&#39;t know about. It still looks kind of cool, like a modern art piece. Place it in your kitchen, and people will never know it doesn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Broken Keychain - 1 dollar</strong></p><p>Do you collect keychains? This one has been through a lot, and a piece is missing, but it&#39;s still shiny! I think it used to belong to my friend Bea. She always keeps her keys in order. Maybe you can fix it or keep it as a small decoration. It&#39;s sure to start a conversation!</p><p>That&#39;s all I have today!</p><p>Call, text, or email me!</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>gem: 英 /dʒem/, 美 /dʒem/ <ul><li>n. 宝石</li><li>宝物, 精华, 珍品, 美丽绝伦的事物</li></ul></li><li>I think it used to <strong>belong</strong> to my friend Bea. <ul><li>belong: possess</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>Hey there!
