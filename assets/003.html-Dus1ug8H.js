What made things worse was that nobody at his workplace even acknowledged his birthday, which left him feeling sad and unappreciated. Lying on the couch was his way of coping with the disappointment and loneliness. It’s clear that he needed a moment to rest and recover from such a <strong>disheartening</strong> experience — one that should have been special but turned out to be overlooked.</p><p>Eddy 躺在沙发上，是因为他在工作中经历了一天的情绪压力。更糟糕的是，办公室里没有人记得他的生日，这让他感到非常失落和被忽视。他选择躺在沙发上，是为了应对这种失望和孤独。显然，他需要片刻的休息来缓解内心的打击 —— 原本应该是特别的一天，却被冷落了。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Junior tried to arrange a special birthday for Eddy.
