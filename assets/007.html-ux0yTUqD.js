I just like dressing up.</li></ul><p>Junior actually wanted to look his best because he knew he&#39;d be walking past Olivia&#39;s house.</p><ul><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Do you own all these dogs?</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: No, I started a successful dog-walking business after my dad refused to let me get my own dog.</li></ul><p>In fact, Junior had begun his dog-walking business <strong>solely</strong> to impress Olivia, since he knew she loved dogs.</p><ul><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Wow, you&#39;re so ambitious!</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: I know. I&#39;m basically a millionaire now, so I can afford ice cream… for two!</li></ul><p>Junior <strong>winks</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Why are you winking at me?</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Because… I was wondering… can I take you to get ice cream sometime? I know you&#39;re dating Andy but…</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: I&#39;m not dating Andy! I just like his dog.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Oh really? So do you want to go on a walk with me and the dogs right now?</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Well, I&#39;m very busy… but I guess I can spare fifteen minutes for dogs.</li></ul><p>The dogs drag Junior down the street as Olivia follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Junior</strong>: So could I meet your parents sometime soon? I would like to introduce myself.</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: What?</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Well, I&#39;m your boyfriend now, right? Should I meet them before or after our first ice cream date?</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Junior, we&#39;re eight! I don&#39;t want a boyfriend until I&#39;m at least twelve.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: Twelve? That&#39;s so old!</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: I know, but I need to travel the world, and publish my novel… and buy a house first!</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: But the housing market is terrible right now!</li><li><strong>Olivia</strong>: Sorry, it&#39;s been fifteen minutes. I have to go.</li></ul><p>Olivia leaves. Junior pulls his bow tie off and lies on the ground.

Why?</strong></p><p>My favorite <strong>moment</strong> in the story was definitely when the two kids were <strong>dreaming about</strong> their future together. Olivia especially impressed me because she had such ambitious goals, like wanting to write her own book and buy her own house someday. It <strong>amused</strong> me that she considered even 12 years old to be already <strong>quite grown-up</strong>. This part stood out because it vividly captured the innocent yet determined mindset children often have about <strong>adulthood</strong>, making the scene both <strong>charming</strong> and <strong>relatable</strong>.</p><p>我最喜欢这个故事的部分，毫无疑问是两个孩子一起畅想未来的时候。Olivia 尤其让我印象深刻，因为她有着非常远大的抱负，比如将来要写一本属于自己的书，还要买一栋自己的房子。更让我感到有趣的是，她甚至觉得 12 岁已经是个相当大的年龄了。这一段特别吸引我，因为它生动地表现了孩子们对长大成人的那种天真又坚定的想法，使得整个情节既可爱又令人产生共鸣。</p><hr><p>My favorite part of the story was the moment when the two children started discussing their <strong>future aspirations</strong>. I found Olivia particularly fascinating because she expressed surprisingly <strong>mature ambitions</strong> for someone so young. She planned not only to write a book but also to buy her own house someday. What amused me most was her <strong>innocent</strong> yet <strong>earnest</strong> opinion that <strong>turning</strong> 12 years old was already too grown-up. This scene <strong>resonated</strong> deeply with me because it perfectly illustrated children&#39;s charming yet <strong>exaggerated perceptions</strong> of adulthood.</p><p>故事里我最喜欢的部分是两个孩子开始讨论他们对未来的憧憬时。我觉得 Olivia 尤其让人着迷，因为她表现出远超年龄的成熟理想。她不仅想写一本属于自己的书，还想将来买一栋房子。最让我感到有趣的是，她天真却又认真的认为 12 岁就已经太大了。这一幕让我产生深刻的共鸣，因为它非常贴切地描绘了孩子们对成年生活既可爱又夸张的认知。</p><hr><ul><li>exaggerated: 英 /ɪɡ&#39;zædʒəreɪtɪd/, 美 /ɪɡ&#39;zædʒəreɪtɪd/ <ul><li>adj. 夸大的,言过其实的,夸张的</li></ul></li><li>perception: 英 /pə&#39;sepʃn/, 美 /pər&#39;sepʃn/ <ul><li>n. 感知(能力)；觉察(力) <ul><li>认识，观念，看法</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What amused me most was her innocent yet earnest opinion that <strong>turning</strong> 12 years old was already too grown-up. <ul><li>The word &quot;turning&quot; here means &quot;becoming&quot; or &quot;reaching&quot; a particular age.
