Not everyone enjoys looking back at history, especially if it feels irrelevant to their daily life. However, in my opinion, understanding the past — even something as recent as the 1970s — is important. It helps us see <strong>how far we’ve come</strong>, appreciate cultural changes, and even learn from past mistakes. Celebrating the seventies is not just about old music or clothes — it’s about <strong>connecting generations</strong> through shared experiences.</p><p>虽然我能理解 Lily 的想法，但我并不同意她的观点。并不是每个人都喜欢回顾历史，尤其是当这些事情看起来与当下生活无关时。然而，在我看来，了解过去——哪怕是像 1970 年代这样并不遥远的时期——依然很重要。它可以帮助我们了解社会的发展，欣赏文化的变化，甚至从过去的错误中吸取教训。庆祝七十年代不仅仅是关于老音乐或老衣服，更是一种跨时代的情感连接。</p><hr><p>I <strong>respectfully disagree with</strong> Lily’s opinion. While she may have her reasons, I believe history plays a vital role in helping us understand who we are and how society has evolved. In my opinion, as human beings, we need to be aware of past events in order to learn from our mistakes and make wiser choices in the future. Ignoring history could mean repeating it. That’s why I strongly believe historical knowledge is essential for progress.</p><p>我对 Lily 的观点表示不同意见。虽然她可能有她的理由，但我认为历史在帮助我们了解自己和社会发展过程方面起着至关重要的作用。在我看来，作为人类，我们需要了解过去的事件，以便从错误中吸取教训，并在未来做出更明智的决策。忽视历史可能会导致重蹈覆辙。因此，我坚信历史知识对于社会进步是必不可少的。</p><hr><p>I don’t really agree with Lily. Personally, I believe people should be aware of their history — especially when it’s still <strong>relatively recent.</strong> Even if some parts of the past are <strong>unpleasant</strong>, it&#39;s important to understand them rather than ignore them.</p><p>我其实不同意 Lily 的观点。就我个人而言，我认为人们应该了解自己的历史 — 尤其是当那段历史离现在还不算太远时。即使有些过去并不令人愉快，我们也应该去理解，而不是选择忽视。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What do you think of Lily&#39;s opinion?</strong></p><p>I agree/ Lily makes/ In my opinion</p><p>I disagree with Lily. she makes her point which I can understand, but in my opinion, people should know their past <s>expecially</s> not a very distant past.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Capitalized &quot;she&quot; at the beginning of the second sentence.</li><li>Changed &quot;her point which I can understand&quot; → &quot;a point which I can understand&quot; for grammatical clarity and smoother phrasing.</li><li>Corrected &quot;expecially&quot; to &quot;especially&quot; (spelling error).</li></ol><p>I disagree with Lily. <strong>She</strong> makes <strong>a point</strong> which I can understand, but in my opinion, people should know their past — <strong>especially</strong> when <strong>it’s</strong> not a very distant one.</p><p>我不同意 Lily 的观点。她的立场我能理解，但在我看来，人们应该了解自己的过去——尤其是并不遥远的过去。</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t agree with Lily.
