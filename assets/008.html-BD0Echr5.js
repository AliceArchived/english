Whoops! It&#39;s the kind of oops that people find hard to stay mad at.</p><p>Remember, life is about having fun and not taking things too seriously.

It feels like the most <strong>natural</strong> and <strong>relatable</strong> one, especially because in real life, people often use this to avoid taking full responsibility. I’ve seen all three types of excuses used in real situations, but this one stands out. After all, nobody is perfect — sometimes, having an excuse makes things a bit easier to handle.</p><p>说实话，我并不特别喜欢提到的任何借口，但如果非要选一个的话，我会选择把错误说成误会这个方式。这种借口听起来最自然，也最贴近现实生活，毕竟人们经常用这种方法来避免承担全部责任。我在现实中也见过三种借口都被使用过，但这个最让我印象深刻。毕竟，没有人是完美的 — 有时候，有个借口确实能让事情更容易处理一点。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which excuse from Lin&#39;s advice is your favorite?</strong></p><p>Help Phrases: I like/ My favorite excuse/ The best part</p><p>I don&#39;t like any of them.
