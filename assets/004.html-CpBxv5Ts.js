I know you were busy with other tasks, so I decided to write your report for you. You&#39;re welcome!</p><p>I clearly typed up all the important numbers and details. It felt like a complicated puzzle, but don&#39;t worry, I solved it. I also added some positive thoughts to make it sound cheerful. I think it will impress our boss!</p><p>I made a special section in your report about budgets. We need to handle money wisely. I thought it was important to show how we can save money for the business. I know you said you were going to include it, but I was faster.</p><p>Finally, I arranged everything neatly, and you&#39;d think I was an artist with those pages. Just make sure you review it soon. The boss wants it on her desk by tomorrow morning. Oh, and don&#39;t worry about staying late to fix it. I promise it&#39;s perfect!</p><p>You&#39;re welcome!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Bea</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>How do you feel about Bea&#39;s help?</strong></p><p>In my opinion, Bea’s help, <strong>although well-intentioned</strong>, may not be <strong>entirely appropriate</strong>. Taking over Emma’s report without asking her first could cause issues later. It might make Emma feel <strong>undermined</strong>, as if Bea doesn’t trust her ability to finish her own work. While teamwork is valuable, boundaries should be respected — otherwise, such help could seem more like <strong>interference</strong> than support. I believe that offering help is best when it&#39;s requested, not when it risks damaging trust or workplace relationships.</p><p>在我看来，虽然 Bea 的出发点是好意，但她的帮助并不完全合适。在没有事先征求 Emma 意愿的情况下替她完成报告，可能会在之后引发问题。Emma 可能会觉得自己的能力被质疑，仿佛 Bea 不信任她能完成自己的工作。虽然团队合作很重要，但也应尊重界限 —— 否则，这种帮助可能看起来更像是干涉而非支持。我认为，只有在别人请求时提供帮助，才更容易被接受，不会伤害信任或同事关系。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>How do you feel about Bea&#39;s help?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I feel/ In my opinion/ Bea&#39;s help</p><p>I feel it is a really bad idea for Bea. In my opinion, Bea&#39;s help may <strong>cause</strong> future troubles in the future. Normally, we should not do anyone else&#39;s job until they ask <strong>us</strong>, otherwise, they may see as a <strong>threat</strong> not a helper.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“cause future troubles in the future” → redundant, &quot;trouble in the future&quot; is clearer.</li><li>“until they ask us” → &quot;unless they ask us&quot; is more appropriate for expressing conditions.</li><li>“they may see as a threat” → missing object, should be “see us as a threat.”</li></ol><p>I feel it is a really bad idea for Bea.
