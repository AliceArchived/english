Why?</strong></p><p>Yes, I’d love to start my own business in the future. I think running a business gives people the chance to deal with real-world challenges — like solving problems, creating something valuable, and making their own decisions. In comparison, working in a typical office can feel limiting, with <strong>internal politics</strong>, <strong>routine tasks</strong>, and <strong>promotion systems</strong> that don’t always reward true ability. Of course, starting a business <strong>takes courage and clear vision</strong>, but it also brings freedom, a strong sense of purpose, and the chance to make a real difference. That’s the kind of career I want to pursue.</p><p>是的，我未来非常想开一家公司。我认为创业能让人面对真实世界的挑战 — 比如解决问题、创造价值，还有做自己的决策。相比之下，在传统办公室工作可能会感觉受限，因为那通常充满内部政治、重复性任务，以及未必真正公平的晋升机制。当然，创业需要勇气和远见，但它也带来自由、强烈的目标感，还有改变世界的机会。这正是我想追求的职业方向。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why does Junior say he couldn&#39;t clean the window?</strong></p><p>Junior says/ couldn&#39;t clean/ tall enough</p><p>Junior says he couldn&#39;t clean now because he isn&#39;t tall enough to reach these windows, but he&#39;s growing.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“clean now” → “clean the windows” (clarifies the object of the verb “clean”)</li><li>“these windows” → <strong>“them”</strong> avoids repetition and improves flow</li><li>Added em dash “ — ” as per your style preference</li><li>“he&#39;s growing” → “<strong>he&#39;s still growing</strong>” makes the contrast more natural and expressive in context</li></ol><p>Junior says he couldn&#39;t clean the windows because he isn&#39;t tall enough to reach <strong>them</strong> — but he&#39;s still growing.</p><p>Junior 说他没办法擦窗户，是因为他个子还不够高，够不着这些窗户 — 但他还在长个子。</p><hr><p><strong>Would you like to have a business?
