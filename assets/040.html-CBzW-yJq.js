Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax. Inviting the fire brigade to put out a non-existent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in. Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.</p><p>When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away, they were not to take him seriously. He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.</p><p>The student hid in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on. Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away. When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by force. The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help. Shortly afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen. As the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill. The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest. Pretending to speak seriously, one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station. Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone. Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.</p><h2 id="new-words-and-expressions-生词和短语" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#new-words-and-expressions-生词和短语"><span>New words and expressions ⽣词和短语</span></a></h2><ul><li>hoax /həʊks/ n. 骗局， 戏弄</li><li>deception /dɪˈsepʃn/ n. 欺骗， 骗局</li><li>self-respecting /.self &#39;rɪspektɪŋ/ adj. ⾃重的</li><li>indulge /ɪnˈdʌldʒ/ v. 使沉迷</li><li>pneumatic /njuː&#39;mætɪk/ adj. ⽓动的</li><li>drill /drɪl/ n. 钻</li><li>silly /&#39;sɪlɪ/ adj. ⽆意义的， ⽆聊的</li><li>advance /ədˈvɑːns/ adj. 预先的， 事先获得的</li><li>archway /&#39;ɑːtʃweɪ/ n . 拱形门楼</li><li>remonstrate 英 /ˈremənstreɪt/ v. 规劝， 告诫</li><li>ironically /aɪ&#39;rɑnɪkli/ adv. 讽刺地</li><li>permission /pəˈmɪʃn/ n. 许可</li><li>grant /ɡrɑːnt/ v. 同意， 准予</li></ul><h2 id="参考译文" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#参考译文"><span>参考译文</span></a></h2><p>谁也弄不清为什么⼤学⽣好像⽐任何⼈都更喜欢恶作剧。⼤学⽣擅长⼀种特殊的恶作剧——戏弄⼈。请消防队来扑灭⼀场根本没有的⼤⽕是⼀种低级骗局，有⾃尊⼼的⼤学⽣决不会去做。⼤学⽣们常常做的是制造⼀种可笑的局⾯，使⼤家笑上⼀场，当然受害者是笑不出来的。</p><p>最近有个学⽣看见两个⼯⼈在⼤学校门外⽤风钻⼲活，马上打电话报告警察，说有两个学⽣装扮成⼯⼈，正在⽤风钻破坏路⾯。挂上电话后，他又马上来到⼯⼈那⼉，告诉他们若有个警察来让他们⾛开，不要把他当回事；还对⼯⼈说，有个学⽣常装扮成警察⽆聊地同别⼈开玩笑。警察与⼯⼈都对那个学⽣事先通报情况表⽰感谢。</p><p>那学⽣躲在附近⼀拱形门廊⾥，在那⼉可以看见、听到现场发⽣的⼀切。果然，警察来了，有礼貌地请⼯⼈离开此地：但其中⼀个⼯⼈粗鲁地回了⼏句。于是警察威胁要强⾏使他们离开。⼯⼈说，悉听尊便。警察去打电请叫⼈。⼀会⼉⼯夫，又来了 4 个警察，规劝⼯⼈离开。由于⼯⼈拒绝停下⼿中的活，警察想夺风钻。两个⼯⼈奋⼒抗争，其中⼀个发了⽕，威胁说要去叫警察。警察听后讥讽地说，这⼤可不必，因为他俩已被逮捕了。其中⼀个⼯⼈装模作样地问道，在被带往警察局之前，是否可以打⼀个电话。警察同意了，陪他来到⼀个投币电话前。当他看到那个⼯⼈真的是给警察挂电话，才恍然⼤悟，原来他们都成了⼀场骗局的受害者。</p><h2 id="单词详解" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#单词详解"><span>单词详解</span></a></h2><h3 id="hoax" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hoax"><span>hoax</span></a></h3><ul><li>hoax [həʊks] <ul><li>n. 恶作剧（骗人相信某事）</li></ul></li><li>hoax n. a kind of <strong>practical joke</strong> in which someone makes people believe something that is not true 恶作剧（骗人相信某事）</li><li>play a <strong>joke</strong> / <strong>trick</strong> on sb.</li><li>make a fool of sb. 作弄某人</li><li>cheat sb. out of sth. 骗某人(钱财) <ul><li>He <strong>cheated</strong> the old lady <strong>out of</strong> her fortune.</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>trick</u></strong> / <strong><u>deceive</u></strong> sb. into doing 欺骗某人做某事 <ul><li>I was <strong><u>tricked</u></strong> / <strong><u>deceived</u></strong> <strong>into</strong> believing his story.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="indulge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#indulge"><span>indulge</span></a></h3><ul><li>indulge [ɪn&#39;dʌldʒ] <ul><li>v. 沉迷于……；尽情享受…… vi</li></ul></li><li>indulge in … vi. <ul><li><strong>indulge in</strong> bad habits</li><li>I <strong>indulged in</strong> <u>a hot bath</u> / <u>an expensive dinner</u> after a day&#39;s hard work.</li></ul></li><li><u>indulge</u> / <u>spoil</u> / <u>pamper</u> sb. vt <ul><li>I don&#39;t agree with <strong>indulging</strong> children.</li></ul></li><li>a <u>spoilt</u> / <u>pampered</u> child</li><li>indulgent / self-indulgent</li><li>indulgence / self-indulgence</li></ul><hr><ul><li>pamper: 英 /ˈpæmpə(r)/, 美 /ˈpæmpər/ <ul><li>vt. 纵容；宠；娇养</li></ul></li><li>indulgent: 英 /ɪnˈdʌldʒənt/, 美 /ɪnˈdʌldʒənt/ <ul><li>adj. 放纵的,纵容的</li><li>adv. 放纵地,纵容地</li></ul></li><li>indulgence: 英 /ɪn&#39;dʌldʒ(ə)ns/, 美 /ɪn&#39;dʌldʒəns/ <ul><li>n. 放纵；纵容；嗜好；沉溺</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="advance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advance"><span>advance</span></a></h3><ul><li>advance: [əd&#39;vɑ:ns] [əd&#39;væns] <ul><li>adj. 提前的（定语）</li></ul></li><li><strong>advance</strong> party 先遣队</li><li>advance <u>notice</u> / <u>warning</u> / <u>planning</u><ul><li>提前 通知/ 警告 / 计划</li></ul></li><li><strong>advance</strong> payment <ul><li>预付款</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="script" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#script"><span>Script</span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Boss</strong>: What a job!
