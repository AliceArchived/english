Why?</p><p>Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get<br> enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day<br> and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.</p><p>One night, however, our vicar work up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking<br> at his watch, he saw that it was one o&#39;clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.<br> Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight,<br> he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.</p><p>&#39;Whatever are you doing up here Bill?&#39; asked the vicar in surprise.</p><p>&#39;I&#39;m trying to repair the bell,&#39; answered Bill. &#39;I&#39;ve been coming up here night after night for<br> weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.&#39;</p><p>&#39;You certainly did give me a surprise!&#39; said the vicar. &#39;You&#39;ve probably woken up everyone in<br> the village as well. Still, I&#39;m glad the bell is working again.&#39;</p><p>&#39;That&#39;s the trouble, vicar,&#39; answered Bill. &#39;It&#39;s working all right, but I&#39;m afraid that at one o&#39;clock<br> it will strike thirteen times and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.&quot;</p><p>&#39;We&#39;ll get used to that, Bill,&#39; said the vicar. &#39;Thirteen is not as good as one, but it&#39;s better than<br> nothing.
