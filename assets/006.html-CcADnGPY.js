This means making <strong>bold</strong> and <strong>exaggerated</strong> gestures to capture attention and emphasize the seriousness of the message. Instead of simply speaking the warning in a flat or casual tone, they should <strong>dramatize</strong> it — much like an actor would in a <strong>theatrical</strong> performance. This approach, he believes, helps ensure the message is taken seriously and remembered.</p><p>Oscar 建议，当人们想要有效地传达警告时，应该像在舞台上表演一样。他的意思是应该使用大胆而夸张的动作，以吸引注意力并强调信息的重要性。与其平淡或随意地说出警告，不如像演员一样戏剧化地表达。他认为这种方式能让人们更加认真地对待警告内容，也更容易记住它。</p><hr><ul><li>exaggerated: 英 /ɪɡ&#39;zædʒəreɪtɪd/, 美 /ɪɡ&#39;zædʒəreɪtɪd/ <ul><li>adj. 夸大的,言过其实的,夸张的</li></ul></li><li>dramatize: 英 /&#39;dræmətaɪz/, 美 /&#39;dræmətaɪz/ <ul><li>vt. 将(小说或事件)改编成剧本</li><li>vt. &amp; vi. 使(事情)戏剧化, 夸张</li></ul></li><li>theatrical: 英 /θi&#39;ætrɪkl/, 美 /θi&#39;ætrɪkl/ <ul><li>adj. 戏剧的；剧场的 <ul><li>炫耀的；戏剧性的；演戏似的；不自然的</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>How does Oscar suggest setting the stage ?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: Oscar suggests/ on stage/ big gestures</p><p>Oscar suggests people should create big gestures when they try to give warnings just as they were on stage.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><p>Oscar suggests people should use big gestures when <strong>delivering</strong> warnings — <strong>as if</strong> they were on stage.</p><p>Oscar 建议人们在发出警告时应使用夸张的手势 — 就像他们在舞台上一样。</p>',32)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",n]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/D/006.html","title":"Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3 A chapter from \\"Living Like an Artist\\" As someone who appreciates the drama of life, I've always thought warnings are best delivered like an opera...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-07-30T04:50:05.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/AliceArchived\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://alicearchived.github.io/english/duolingo/story/D/006.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"English Study Record"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3 A chapter from \\"Living Like an Artist\\" As someone who appreciates the drama of life, I've always thought warnings are best delivered like an opera..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-07-30T04:50:05.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"story"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Duolingo"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"English"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-07-30T04:50:05.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1753828450000,"updatedTime":1753851005000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice","username":"Alice","email":"alys8715ia@gmail.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Alice"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.85,"words":856},"filePathRelative":"duolingo/story/D/006.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>A chapter from \\"Living Like an Artist\\"</p>\\n<p>As someone who appreciates the drama of life, I've always thought warnings are best delivered like an opera.
