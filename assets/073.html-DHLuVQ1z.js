Why?</p><p>Yes, I think Lucy has <strong>a good reason</strong> to feel nervous about the date. While it&#39;s natural to feel <strong>nostalgic</strong> about the past, the <strong>reality</strong> is that time often changes people in ways we don&#39;t expect. Sometimes, when we <strong>reunite with</strong> someone we haven&#39;t seen <strong>in years</strong>, the <strong>connection</strong> we once had is <strong>no longer there</strong>. Personally, I&#39;ve had experiences where I preferred to <strong>hold on to</strong> the happy memories rather than risk ruining them by facing the present. So I can understand why Lucy might be worried — it&#39;s not easy to <strong>confront</strong> how things have changed.</p><p>是的，我认为 Lucy 有理由为这次约会感到紧张。虽然人们怀念过去是很自然的事，但现实往往是，时间会让人发生许多意想不到的变化。有时候，当我们和多年未见的旧人重逢时，曾经的那种联系可能已经不复存在。我自己也有过类似的经历，宁愿保留那些美好的回忆，也不想因为重新相见而让回忆变得尴尬或失色。所以我完全理解露西为什么会担心——面对时间带来的变化确实不容易。</p><ul><li>nostalgic: 英 /nə&#39;stældʒɪk/, 美 /nə&#39;stældʒɪk/ <ul><li>adj. 对往事怀恋的, 怀旧的</li></ul></li><li>confront: 英 /kənˈfrʌnt/, 美 /kənˈfrʌnt/ <ul><li>vt. 遭遇；比较；面对</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p>Do you think Lucy should worry about the date? Why?</p><p>Yes, Lucy should worry about the date. We all have good memories <s>about</s> our <strong>youth</strong>. But time is <strong>cruel</strong> — it changes everything. <s>A lot of times</s>, if someone I haven&#39;t seen for a long time, I&#39;d rather not see them again. Just keep the good memories.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“We all have good memories about our <strong>youth</strong>.” <ul><li>→ should be &quot;<strong>of</strong> our youth&quot;.</li></ul></li><li>“A lot of times, if someone I haven&#39;t seen for a long time, I&#39;d rather not see them again.” <ul><li>→ this sentence structure is awkward and incomplete. Better: “Often, when I haven&#39;t seen someone for a long time, I&#39;d rather not see them again.”</li></ul></li><li>“Just keep the good memories.” <ul><li>→ grammatically fine, but should be linked to the previous sentence more smoothly.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Yes, Lucy should worry about the date. We all have good memories <strong>of</strong> our <strong>youth</strong>, but time is <strong>cruel</strong> — it <strong>changes</strong> everything. <strong>Often</strong>, when I <strong>haven&#39;t seen</strong> someone for a long time, I&#39;d rather not see them again. <strong>It&#39;s better to</strong> just keep the good memories.</p><p>是的，露西应该为这次约会感到担心。我们每个人对青春都有美好的回忆，但时间是残酷的——它改变了一切。很多时候，当我很久没有见过一个人时，我宁愿不再见他们。保留美好的回忆就好。</p>',18)]))}const h=t(i,[["render",s]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/T/073.html","title":"The Reunion","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"The Reunion Lucy is getting ready for a date.
