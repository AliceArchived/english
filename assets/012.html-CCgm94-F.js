In many cases, simply talking to someone isn’t enough to make them realize their mistakes. <strong>People tend to learn best from personal experiences</strong> — when they face the consequences of their actions, they’re more likely to reflect and truly understand what needs to change. I believe <strong>Lucy’s approach</strong>, while a bit indirect, was effective because it gave Lin the chance to learn from the situation herself.</p><p>如果我是露西，我想我可能也会采取类似的做法。在很多情况下，单纯与某人交谈并不足以让他们意识到自己的错误。人们往往通过亲身经历来获得最深刻的教训 —— 当他们面对自己行为的后果时，才更有可能反思并真正明白需要改变的地方。我认为露西的方法虽然有些间接，但很有效，因为它让林有机会从事件中自己学到教训。</p><hr><p><strong>Why does Lucy let Lou stay on the couch?</strong></p><p>Lucy allows Lou to stay on the couch <strong>as a way to teach Lin a lesson</strong> — to help her realize just how frustrating it can be to live with someone who behaves like she does.</p><p>Lucy 让 Lou 睡在沙发上，是想借此教 Lin 一课 — 让她意识到和一个像她那样的人一起生活会有多令人烦恼。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why does Lucy let Lou stay on the couch?</strong></p><p>Lucy lets/ to teach/ Lin to</p><p>Lucy lets Lou stay on the couch to teach Lin a lesson so she can realize how annoying to live with someone like Lin herself.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“how annoying to live...” → 应为 “how annoying it is to live...” 缺少形式主语 it</li><li>“like Lin herself” → 更自然写法为 “like herself”（避免重复“Lin”，上下文已经清楚）</li></ol><p>Lucy lets Lou stay on the couch to teach Lin a lesson — so Lin can realize how annoying <strong>it is</strong> to live with someone <strong>like herself</strong>.</p><p>Lucy 让 Lou 睡沙发，是为了给 Lin 上一课 — 让她意识到，和像她这样的人一起住是多么烦人。</p><hr><p><strong>If you were Lucy, how would you teach Lin a lesson?
