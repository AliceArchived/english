While watching, he was caught up in the plot and the action, so he might have <strong>overlooked</strong> <strong>subtle clues</strong> or <strong>symbolic elements</strong>. That’s why, even after the movie finished, he kept thinking about it and replaying certain <strong>scenes</strong> in his mind, trying to figure out if there was a hidden meaning that completely <strong>escaped</strong> him.</p><p>Oscar 担心电影的结局，因为他觉得可能存在某种他没有完全理解的更深层信息。观看时，他被情节和动作吸引，可能忽略了一些微妙的线索或象征性元素。因此，即使电影结束后，他仍不断地思考，并在脑海中重播某些场景，试图弄清是否有某种隐藏含义完全被自己忽略了。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><p>This version reaches Band 7+ for speaking because it uses a range of vocabulary (“subtle clues,” “symbolic elements,” “<strong>completely escaped him</strong>”), varied sentence structures, and natural linking phrases (“while watching,” “that’s why”).

This uncertainty has left him reflecting on whether the director intentionally included subtle hints that were meant to provoke deeper thought. Consequently, even after the <strong>credits</strong> rolled, Oscar continued to analyze and reinterpret the conclusion, attempting to determine if he had missed a significant hidden meaning.</p><p>Oscar 对电影的结局感到困扰，因为他怀疑其中可能存在自己未能察觉的潜在信息。观影过程中，他的注意力主要集中在表层的动作和情节发展上，这可能使他忽视了结尾中隐藏的象征性细节或主题细微之处。这种不确定感让他反思导演是否有意加入了旨在引发更深层思考的微妙提示。因此，即使字幕结束后，Oscar 仍在不断分析和重新解读结局，试图确定自己是否错过了重要的隐藏含义。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><p>This version achieves Band 7+ for writing because it is precise, well-organized, and uses formal vocabulary (“underlying message,” “thematic nuances,” “intentionally included subtle hints”).
