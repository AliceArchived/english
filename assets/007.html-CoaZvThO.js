The baker is running a business, and his recipe is <strong>a key part</strong> of that, so it <strong>makes sense</strong> that he wants to protect it. It&#39;s like a trade secret, and sharing it could hurt his <strong>competitive edge</strong>. Vikram, on the other hand, is just baking for his wife, so he doesn’t need to be as <strong>protective</strong> of his own recipe. Still, I admire Vikram’s creativity—offering the baker a better recipe was a smart move. In the end, the baker might have appreciated it enough to share his own recipe.</p><p>我同意面包师的做法，虽然我觉得 Vikram 的尝试也很聪明。面包师是做生意的，他的配方是他成功的关键之一，所以他不愿意分享也是可以理解的，就像商业机密一样。如果随便公开可能会影响他的竞争力。而 Vikram 只是想为妻子做点心，所以他自己的配方并不需要保密。尽管如此，我很佩服 Vikram 的聪明，他提出一个更好的配方给面包师，算是一种交换。最后面包师可能也因为这个感到欣赏，愿意把自己的配方分享出来。</p><p><strong>competitive edge</strong></p><p>Competitive edge = a special advantage that helps a person, product, or company do better than others in a competition or market.</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p>What do you think? Do you agree with Vikram or the baker? Why?</p><p>I agree with the baker but <s>Vikram&#39;s try is great</s>. For the baker, he is running a business, the recipe actually is a business secret, so it makes sense not to tell anyone else. For Vikram, he just makes pastries for his wife, it doesn&#39;t matter if others know his <strong>recipe</strong>. But Vikram is smart, he offers a better recipe to the baker, the baker <strong>probably</strong> gives his recipe to Vikram in the end.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>&quot;Vikram&#39;s try is great&quot; → should be &quot;<strong>Vikram&#39;s effort was impressive</strong>&quot; or &quot;a good try&quot;</li><li>&quot;the recipe actually is a business secret&quot; → better phrased as &quot;the recipe is <strong>essentially</strong> a trade secret&quot;</li><li>&quot;doesn&#39;t matter if others know his recipe&quot; → better phrased: &quot;it’s not a big deal if others know his recipe&quot;</li></ol><p>I agree with the baker, but I think <strong>Vikram&#39;s effort was impressive</strong>.
