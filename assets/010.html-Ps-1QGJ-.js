I like a more relaxed <strong>tour</strong>, <strong>rather than</strong> trying to see as <strong>many</strong> tourist sites as possible. If we want to learn about the <strong>tourist sites</strong>, it&#39;s convenient to check all the information online, <strong>so</strong> we don&#39;t need to exhaust <strong>ourselves</strong>. <strong>By visiting</strong> sites <strong>in</strong> a more <strong>relaxed</strong> way, we can better <strong>experience</strong> nature and culture.</p><hr><p>I would prefer to go on a tour with Lin.
