He might call it, for example, &quot;Asteroid 3251.&quot;<br> 当一个天文学者发现了其中一个星星，他不会给它起名，而只是给它一个编号，例如他可能会把它称作“3251 小行星”。</p><p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.<br> 我有确切的理由认为小王子所来自的那个星球是小行星 B612。</p><p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.<br> 这颗小行星仅仅在 1909 年被一个土耳其天文学家用望远镜看见过一次。</p><p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration.<br> 他在一次演示中向国际天文学家代表大会展示了他的发现。</p><p>But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said. Grown-ups are like that...<br> 但由于他所穿的是土耳其服饰，所以没有人相信他所说的。那些大人们就是这样。</p><p>Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.<br> 然而幸好，为了小行星 B612 的声誉，土耳其的一个独裁者制定了法律：他的人民都要穿欧式服装，否则就处以死刑。</p><p>So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.<br> 于是到了 1920 年，这位天文学家穿了一身非常时尚优雅的服装，重新作了一次论证。</p><p>And this time everybody accepted his report.<br> 这一次所有的人都接受了他的报告。</p><p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. Grown-ups love figures.<br> 如果我已经给你们讲过关于小行星 B612 的这些细节，并且告诉你们它的编号，这是出于大人们以及他们的方式而考虑。大人们就爱数字。</p><p>When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.<br> 当你给他们讲起你交了一个新朋友时，他们从来不问你实质性的问题。</p><p>They never say to you, &quot;What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?&quot;<br> 他们从来不讲：“他说话声音什么样啊？他最喜欢什么样的游戏啊？他是否收集蝴蝶标本呀？”</p><p>Instead, they demand: &quot;How old is he?<br> 他们却问你：“他多大年纪呀？</p><p>How many brothers has he?<br> 他弟兄几个呀？</p><p>How much does he weigh?&quot;<br> 他体重多少呀？”</p><p>&quot;How much money does his father make?&quot;<br> “他父亲挣多少钱呀？”</p><p>Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.<br> 只有通过这些数字他们才认为了解了他。</p><p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: &quot;I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,&quot; they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.<br> 如果你对大人们说：“我看到一幢用玫瑰色的砖盖成的漂亮的房子，它的窗户上有天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子……”他们一点也想象不出这种房子什么样子的。</p><p>You would have to say to them: &quot;I saw a house that cost $20,000.&quot;<br> 你必须对他们说：“我看见了一幢价值两万美元的房子。”</p><p>Then they would exclaim: &quot;Oh, what a pretty house that is!&quot;<br> 那么他们就惊叫道：“多么漂亮的房子啊！”</p><p>Just so, you might say to them: &quot;The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep.&quot;<br> 因此，你也许会对他们说：“小王子存在的证据就是他很迷人，他会笑，而且他正在寻找一只羊。”</p><p>&quot;If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.&quot;<br> “如果有人想要一只羊，这就是他存在的证明。”</p><p>And what good would it do to tell them that?<br> 这么给他们说会有什么好处？</p><p>They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.<br> 他们会耸耸肩膀，把你当作孩子看待。</p><p>But if you said to them: &quot;The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,&quot; then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.<br> 但是，如果你对他们说：“小王子来自的星球就是小行星 B612”，那么他们就十分信服，不再向你追问个没完。</p><p>They are like that. One must not hold it against them.<br> 他们就是这样的。我们千万不要因此而跟他们作对。</p><p>Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.<br> 小孩子们应该永远对大人表现出极大的宽容。</p><p>But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference.<br> 当然，对我们懂得生活的人来说，数字都是些无关紧要的事。</p><p>I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales.<br> 我本想像讲童话故事那样开始讲这个故事。</p><p>I should have liked to say: &quot;Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep...&quot;<br> 我本想这样说：“从前呀，有一个小王子，他住在一个和他身体差不多大的星球上，他希望有一只羊……”</p><p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.<br> 对懂得生活的人来说，这样说就显得真实得多。</p><p>For I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly.<br> 我可不喜欢人们轻率地读我的书。</p><p>I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories.<br> 我在写下这些记忆的时候心情是很难过的。</p><p>Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep.<br> 我的朋友带着他的小羊已经离去六年了。</p><p>If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him.<br> 我在这里尽力描述他，是为了确定我没有忘记他。</p><p>To forget a friend is sad. Not everyone has had a friend.<br> 忘记一个朋友太让人悲伤了。并不是所有的人都有过一个朋友。</p><p>And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...<br> 再说，如果我忘了他，我也可能变成那些只对数字感兴趣的大人们。</p><p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils.<br> 也正是为了这个目的，我买了一盒颜料和一些画笔。</p><p>It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six.<br> 像我这样年纪的人很难再开始绘画，我除了六岁时画过蟒蛇的内部和外部以外，别的什么也没画过。</p><p>I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success.<br> 我一定要把我的画尽量地画得贴近生活，但我自己也没有成功的把握。</p><p>One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject.<br> 一张画得还可以，另一张一点也不像画的对象。</p><p>I make some errors, too, in the little prince&#39;s height: in one place he&#39;s too tall and in another too short.<br> 对于小王子的身高，我也犯了一些错误。在一个地方小王子画得太高，另一个地方又画得太矮。</p><p>And I feel some doubts about the colors of his costume.<br> 对他衣服的颜色我也拿不准。</p><p>So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.<br> 于是我就尽力地摸索着，一会儿好一会儿坏，我希望能画得差不多就行。</p><p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also.<br> 我也可能在某些重要的细节上犯错。</p><p>But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me.<br> 但有些事情不是我的错。我的朋友从来没有给我解释任何事情。</p><p>He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself.<br> 他可能以为我同他一样。</p><p>But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes.<br> 唉，可是我不知道如何透过盒子的四壁看小羊。</p><p>Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.<br> 或许我有点像那些大人们吧。我一定是变老了。</p>',55)]))}const d=t(s,[["render",i]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/reading/prince/003.html","title":"Chapter 03","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Writing"],"tag":["小王子"],"toc":true,"description":"Chapter 03 《小王子》全集 (上) ffmpeg -i xiao1.mp3 -ss 00:11:34 -to 00:17:05 -c copy chapter3.mp3 I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the litt...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Chapter 03\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-08-05T19:47:06.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/AliceArchived\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://alicearchived.github.io/english/reading/prince/003.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"English Study Record"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Chapter 03"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Chapter 03 《小王子》全集 (上) ffmpeg -i xiao1.mp3 -ss 00:11:34 -to 00:17:05 -c copy chapter3.mp3 I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the litt..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-08-05T19:47:06.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"小王子"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-08-05T19:47:06.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1754277032000,"updatedTime":1754423226000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice","username":"Alice","email":"alys8715ia@gmail.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Alice"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":7.52,"words":2257},"filePathRelative":"reading/prince/003.md","excerpt":"\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StNJHi5b2oM&amp;t=667s\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">《小王子》全集 (上) </a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<audio controls=\\"\\">\\n  <source src=\\"/audio/reading/prince/chapter3.mp3\\" type=\\"audio/mpeg\\">\\n  check your browser for video.\\n</audio>\\n<div style=\\"display: none;\\">\\nffmpeg -i  xiao1.mp3 -ss 00:11:34 -to 00:17:05 -c copy chapter3.mp3\\n</div>","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,u as data};
