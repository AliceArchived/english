If Mira thinks Eddy isn&#39;t sensitive enough, and Eddy tried different ways and still failed to solve the problem, then Eddy should let this relationship to. For <strong>long-term</strong> <strong>relationships</strong>, it&#39;s better to be himself.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“they both feel comfortable with” <ul><li>→ unclear if Mira is still relevant.
