But in the end, when she found <strong>someone</strong> who <strong>was</strong> actually very talented, she and Zari thought the act was too good and might make their own performance look worse — so they decided to <strong>go with</strong> the mime instead.</p><p>故事中，一开始 Lily 想找一些好的表演者。她拒绝了她认为不够好的表演者。但最后，当她真的遇到一个很有才华的人时，她和 Zari 却觉得这个人太出色了，可能会让她们自己的表演显得更差——于是她们决定选那个哑剧表演。</p><hr><h3 id="polished" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#polished"><span>Polished</span></a></h3><p>In the story, Lily and Zari are choosing performers for their school’s talent show. Lily <strong>keeps rejecting</strong> everyone because she’s worried that <strong>boring acts will make the audience leave</strong> before their band performs. Then, when two talented girls perform an amazing song, Lily <strong>admits</strong> they’re really good—maybe even better than their band. Zari then refuses to accept them, afraid that such a great act will make their own performance look worse. In the end, they decide to accept <strong>the juggling mime</strong> instead, just so their band won’t be <strong>outshined</strong>.</p><p>故事中，Lily 和 Zari 正在为学校的才艺秀挑选表演者。Lily 一开始把所有人都拒绝了，因为她担心如果节目太无聊，观众会在她们乐队表演之前就离场。后来，当两个女孩演奏了一首很棒的摇滚歌曲时，Lily 承认她们可能比自己的乐队还厉害。于是 Zari 拒绝录取这组表演者，因为她担心观众拿来和她们的演出比较，会显得她们逊色。最后，为了不被比下去，她们反而选择了那个表演杂耍的哑剧演员。</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>一个耍杂技的哑剧演员？哑剧演员不应该有道具的。 <ul><li>A juggling mime?
