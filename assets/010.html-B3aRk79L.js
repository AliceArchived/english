Junior wanted to <strong>recover</strong> an old action figure he had hidden under the floorboard because figures with shields <strong>have become</strong> valuable. However, he only found one with an axe, which wasn’t worth anything. <strong>While</strong> Junior was searching, Eddy broke the stationary bike by pedaling too hard. The <strong>current tenant</strong> got angry and demanded the toy in return for the damage. In the end, Junior gave him the action figure.</p><p>在这个故事中，Eddy 和 Junior 回到了他们三年前住过的公寓。Junior 想找回自己藏在地板下的一个动作玩偶，因为带盾牌的玩偶现在很值钱。但他只找到一个带斧头的玩偶，没有什么价值。在 Junior 寻找玩具的时候，Eddy 骑固定脚踏车时太用力，把它弄坏了。现在的房客很生气，并要求用那个玩偶来赔偿。最后，Junior 把玩偶给了他。</p><p>why did I say &quot;tenant&quot;?</p><p>I used &quot;current tenant&quot; because:</p><ol><li>It avoids assuming ownership.</li><li>In everyday English, &quot;tenant&quot; just means a person who lives there now, whether they rent or own.</li><li>It keeps the story neutral and accurate since we don’t know if he owns the place.</li></ol><hr><ul><li>tenant: 英 /ˈtenənt/, 美 /ˈtenənt/ <ul><li>n. 房客, 佃户, 承租人</li><li>〈律〉占用者, 占有者</li></ul></li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Word</th><th>Accurate?</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Owner</td><td>❌</td><td>Not confirmed in the story</td></tr><tr><td>Tenant</td><td>✅</td><td>Likely, but still assumed</td></tr><tr><td>Resident</td><td>✅✅✅</td><td>Safe and neutral</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What happened in the story?</strong></p><p>In the story, Eddy and Junior went back to their old apartment where they moved out three years ago.
