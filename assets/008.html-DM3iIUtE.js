I have my claws.&quot;<br> 你就要到远方去了……至于说大动物，我并不怕，我有自己的爪子。”</p><p>And, naively, she showed her four thorns.<br> 于是，她天真地露出她的四根刺。<br> Then she added: &quot; Don&#39;t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go! &quot;<br> 随后她又说：“别磨蹭了。你既然决定离开这儿，现在就走吧！”<br> For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...<br> 因为她不想让他看见她哭泣。她是一朵非常骄傲的花……</p><p>He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325,326,327,328,329, and 330.<br> 他发现自己的周围还有 325、326、327、328、329、330 等几颗小行星。<br> He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.<br> 因此他就开始访问它们，以增长知识。<br> The first of them was inhabited by a king.<br> 第一颗星球上住着一个国王。<br> Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.<br> 他穿着蓝紫色的貂皮（长袍），坐在一个很简单却又十分威严的宝座上。<br> &quot;Ah!

It is years since I have seen anyone yawning.<br> 国王说：“那好吧，我命令你打哈欠。好些年来我都没有看见过任何人打哈欠了。</p><p>Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity.<br> 对我来说，打哈欠倒是新奇的事。<br> Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.&quot;<br> 来吧，现在！再打个哈欠！这是命令。”<br> &quot; That frightens me... I cannot, any more..&quot; murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.<br> “这倒是吓到我了….我打不出哈欠来了…”小王子红着脸嘟囔说。<br> &quot;Hum! Hum!&quot; replied the king.&quot; Then I-- I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--&quot;<br> “嗯！嗯！”国王回答道：“那么我.…•命令你忽而打哈欠，忽而…”<br> He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.<br> 他嘟嘟囔囔，显出有点恼怒。</p><p>For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected<br> 因为国王所坚持的主要是保持他的威严受到尊敬。<br> He tolerated no disobedience.<br> 他不能容忍违抗命令。<br> He was an absolute monarch.<br> 他是一位专制的君主。<br> But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.<br> 可是因为他很善良，他下的命令都是合理的。</p><p>&quot;If l ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general.
