During the roller coaster ride, he screamed so loudly that it might have seemed a bit annoying to her. She might have expected him to stay calm or at least try to enjoy the ride. So, after the experience, she may feel that Junior is not really the kind of person who enjoys thrills or challenges.</p><p>我觉得莉莉可能认为小家伙不太勇敢，也很容易被吓到。在坐过山车的时候，他尖叫得特别大声，可能让莉莉觉得有点烦人。她或许原本希望他能冷静点，或者至少试着享受一下刺激。所以在这次经历之后，她可能会觉得小家伙不是那种喜欢冒险或挑战的人。</p><hr><p>I believe that Lily <s>get</s> a worse impression <s>about</s> Junior after riding the roller coaster.
