Also, she doesn&#39;t seem to focus on doing the job <strong>properly</strong>.</p><p>不，我不认为 Lily 会是个好经理，因为她自己工作就做得不好。她是因为客户喜欢她才被提拔的，而不是因为表现出色。如果她连自己的工作都管理不好，又怎么能带领别人做好工作呢？而且她似乎也不专注于把工作做好。</p><hr><p><strong>[Rewritten Answer]</strong><br> I don’t think Lily will be a good manager. She doesn’t take her job seriously—she arrives late, doesn’t clean the store, and plays loud music just to avoid talking to customers. Even though customers seem to like her attitude, she clearly isn’t interested in responsibility. In fact, as soon as she got promoted, she decided not to work that day!</p><p>我认为莉莉不会是一个好经理。她对工作不够认真——她经常迟到、不打扫店面，还故意放很吵的音乐来避免和顾客交流。虽然顾客似乎喜欢她的态度，但她显然不愿意承担责任。事实上，她一被升职就决定当天不工作了！</p>',21)]))}const h=t(r,[["render",i]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/I/013.html","title":"I'm the Manager","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"I'm the Manager Lily arrives at the clothing store where she works.
