A woman <strong>waves</strong> to him, and Eddy <strong>assumes</strong> she’s his date. He quickly sits down, apologizes, and starts chatting with her.</p><p>At first, the woman seems a bit serious, but Eddy tries to be charming. He compliments her suit and jokes about not wearing a tie. She says she only has twenty minutes, which <strong>surprises</strong> Eddy, but he goes along with it.</p><p>As they talk, Eddy shares that he’s a gym teacher at a high school and even mentions that he has an eight-year-old son. He thinks everything is going well — until the woman suddenly asks about his job skills. Eddy is confused and asks, “Do you always talk about work this much on a first date?” That’s when she tells him this isn’t a date — it’s actually a <strong>job interview</strong>.</p><p>Eddy is shocked. He looks at his phone and realizes he <strong>mixed up</strong> his appointments. The woman <strong>introduces</strong> herself <strong>as</strong> Liz, from the downtown gym, and says they’re hiring a manager to work evenings and weekends. Eddy asks if he can still get the job. She firmly says no. Eddy <strong>laughs</strong> it <strong>off</strong> and says, “Well, now my nights and weekends are free for dates!”</p><p>在这个故事中，Eddy 到餐厅后告诉服务员他要见一个约会对象，但他迟到了。这时一个女士向他招手，Eddy 就以为她是他要见的人。他立刻坐下来道歉，并开始和她聊天。</p><p>一开始，这位女士显得有点严肃，但 Eddy 试图用幽默让气氛轻松。他夸她穿得很正式，还调侃自己没打领带。女士说她只有二十分钟时间，Eddy 很惊讶，但还是继续配合。</p><p>他们谈话时，Eddy 说自己是高中体育老师，还提到他有个八岁的儿子。他觉得两人相处得不错，结果对方突然开始问他职业技能。他一脸懵，问她：“你第一次约会就聊这么多工作吗？”这时女士才告诉他：<strong>这根本不是约会，是一场面试</strong>。</p><p>Eddy 大吃一惊。他看了一眼手机，才发现自己搞错了约见对象。女士自我介绍说她是市中心那家健身房的 Liz，正在招聘晚上和周末班的经理。Eddy 还问她自己能不能应聘。她直接拒绝。Eddy 只好自嘲说：“那我现在晚上和周末都空出来了，可以去约会啦！”</p><p><strong>laugh off something</strong> = <strong>用笑的方式轻描淡写地处理某事</strong>， 通常指<strong>不把尴尬、批评或失败当回事</strong>，用笑一笑的方式“化解”局面。</p><table><thead><tr><th>例句</th><th>中文意思</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>She forgot her lines on stage but laughed it off.</td><td>她在台上忘词了，但笑一笑就轻松带过了。</td></tr><tr><td>He was late to the meeting, but tried to laugh it off like it was nothing.</td><td>他开会迟到了，但试图一笑了之，好像没什么大不了的。</td></tr><tr><td>When people teased him about his haircut, he just laughed it off.</td><td>别人取笑他的发型，他只是笑笑带过。</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>laugh off</strong> 的对象通常是<strong>尴尬、不快、批评、失败</strong>等负面事件</p><p>语气通常是轻松、幽默、无所谓</p><p>通常结构是：<strong>laugh off + 名词</strong> 或 <strong>laugh it off</strong></p><p>“<strong>laugh off</strong>” 可以翻译为：</p><ul><li>一笑置之</li><li>笑着带过</li><li>幽默化解</li><li>不当回事地笑掉</li></ul>',34)]))}const h=e(a,[["render",r]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/S/009.html","title":"Sorry I'm Late","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Sorry I'm Late Eddy arrives at a restaurant.
