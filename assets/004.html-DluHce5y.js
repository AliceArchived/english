So why do we use the same word for watching movies? <br> It&#39;s because a &quot;movie marathon&quot; implies watching multiple movies, usually with a common theme or featuring the same actors/directors, in a single sitting or over a short period. This can indeed take a considerable amount of time and require some &quot;endurance&quot; from the viewer! <br>Here&#39;s why the term &quot;marathon&quot; is used for movies:</p><ul><li>Extended duration:<br> Just like a running marathon, a movie marathon involves a prolonged activity. <br>Watching several movies back-to-back takes up a significant chunk of time, often several hours.</li><li>Emphasis on quantity:<br>It&#39;s not just about watching one movie; it&#39;s about watching many in succession. This highlights the quantity and duration of the viewing experience.</li><li><strong>Sense of accomplishment:</strong> Completing a movie marathon can feel like an achievement, similar to finishing a running marathon. There&#39;s a sense of dedication and commitment involved.</li></ul></li><li><p>你因为在 K-pop 演唱会上尖叫，现在得了喉炎，说不了话了？</p></li><li><p>You can&#39;t talk because you have <strong>laryngitis</strong> after screaming at a K-pop concert?</p></li><li><p><strong>“Zari jumps up and down with excitement”</strong> – perfectly fine, but could be written more vividly like:<br> ✅ <em>Zari practically bounces with excitement.</em></p></li><li><p>属于风格调整</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="what-happened-in-the-story" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened-in-the-story"><span>What happened in the story?</span></a></h3><p>In the story, Zari sang songs to hard so she couldn&#39;t talk.

Lily put her own <strong>ideas</strong> together with Zari&#39;s <strong>wishes</strong>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>“sang K-pop too loudly”</strong><br> ✔️ 语法没错，但更贴近故事表达应是：<strong>“lost her voice after screaming at a K-pop concert”</strong> 或 <strong>“got laryngitis after a K-pop concert”</strong>。</li><li><strong>“Lily spoke everything for Zari”</strong><br> → 结构略生硬，可改为更自然的表达：<strong>“Lily spoke on Zari’s behalf”</strong> 或 <strong>“Lily spoke for her”</strong></li><li><strong>“as Zari’s wanted”</strong><br> ❌ 语法错误。应为：<strong>“as Zari wanted”</strong>（没有所有格）</li><li><strong>“put her own ideas together with Zari’s wishes”</strong><br> ✔️ 基本能理解，但搭配不够自然。建议改为：<strong>“mixed her own ideas with Zari’s wishes”</strong> 或 <strong>“added her own opinions instead of saying exactly what Zari meant”</strong></li></ul></blockquote><p>In the story, Zari <strong>lost her voice</strong> after screaming too much at a K-pop concert, so Lily had to <strong>speak for</strong> her. <strong>However</strong>, Lily didn’t always say exactly what Zari wanted. She <strong>added</strong> her own opinions and <strong>changed</strong> what Zari <strong>meant</strong>.</p><p>在故事中，Zari 因为在 K-pop 演唱会上喊得太用力，结果嗓子哑了说不了话，于是 Lily 代替她发言。但 Lily 并不总是准确表达 Zari 的意思，而是加上了自己的想法，改变了原意。</p><hr><p>一个语法正确、内容完整、表达自然的回答：</p><p>In the story, Zari <strong>loses her voice</strong> after screaming <strong>at</strong> a K-pop concert, so she <strong>gets</strong> laryngitis and can&#39;t talk. At school, Lily <strong>offers</strong> to speak for her, but <strong>instead of saying</strong> what Zari actually wants to say, Lily <strong>adds</strong> her own <strong>ideas</strong>. When Zari&#39;s <strong>crush</strong>, Troy, asks her out, Lily keeps <strong>rejecting</strong> him <strong>on Zari’s behalf</strong>—even though Zari wants to say yes. In the end, Lily agrees to let Zari go to the dance with Troy, but only <strong>under conditions</strong> Lily <strong>makes up</strong> herself.</p><p>在故事中，Zari 因为在 K-pop 演唱会上喊太多而失声，得了喉炎，无法说话。她在学校时，Lily 主动提出替她发言，但却没有按照 Zari 的意思去说，而是加入了自己的想法。当 Zari 暗恋的男生 Troy 来邀约她时，Lily 一再代她拒绝——尽管 Zari 非常想答应。最后，Lily 终于“同意”让她和 Troy 去舞会，但附加了一些完全由她自己编的条件。</p>',43)]))}const g=e(i,[["render",a]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/L/004.html","title":"Lily the Interpreter - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Lily the Interpreter - B2 Lily arrives at school and sees her friend Zari waiting for her.
