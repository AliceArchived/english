Flowers have thorns just for spite!&quot;<br> “刺么，什么用都没有，这纯粹是花的恶劣表现。”</p><p>&quot;Oh!&quot; There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:<br> “噢！”他完全沉默了一会之后，怀着不满的心情冲我说：</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive.<br> “我不信！花是弱小的生物，它们是天真的。</p><p>They reassure themselves as best they can.<br> 它们尽可能地保护自己。</p><p>They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons...&quot;<br> 它们以为它们的刺是很厉害的武器……”</p><p>I did not answer.<br> 我默不作声。</p><p>At that instant I was saying to myself: &#39;If this bolt still won&#39;t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.&#39;<br> 我当时想的，如果这个螺丝再不转动的话，我就一锤子敲掉它。</p><p>Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.<br> 小王子又来打搅我的思绪了：</p><p>&quot;And you actually believe that the flowers—&quot;<br> “你真的认为花——”</p><p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; I cried. &quot;No, no no! I don&#39;t believe anything.&quot;<br> 我喊道：“哦，不！不，不，不！我什么也不相信！”</p><p>I answered you with the first thing that came into my head.<br> 我只是想到什么就随便回答你什么。</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t you see — I am very busy with matters of consequence!&quot;<br> “你难道没看到我有正经事要做吗！”</p><p>He stared at me, thunderstruck. &quot;Matters of consequence!&quot;<br> 他惊讶地盯着我。“正经事？”</p><p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly.<br> 他瞅着我拿着锤子，手指沾满了油污，伏在一个在他看来丑不可言的机件上。</p><p>&quot;You talk just like the grown-ups!&quot; That made me a little ashamed.<br> “你说话就和那些大人一样！”这话使我有点难堪。</p><p>But he went on, relentlessly:<br> 可是他又尖刻无情地说道：</p><p>&quot;You mix everything up together... You confuse everything...&quot;<br> “你什么都分不清……你把什么都混在一起！”</p><p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.<br> 他着实非常恼火。摇动着脑袋，金黄色的头发随风飘动着。</p><p>&quot;I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman.<br> “我知道有一个星球上面住着一位红脸先生。”</p><p>He has never smelled a flower.<br> 他从来没闻过一朵花。</p><p>He has never looked at a star.<br> 他从来没有看过一颗星星。</p><p>He has never loved anyone.<br> 他什么人也没喜欢过。</p><p>He has never done anything in his life but add up figures.<br> 除了算账以外，他什么也没有做过。</p><p>And all day he says over and over, just like you: &quot;I am busy with matters of consequence!&quot;<br> 他整天同你一样老是说：“我有正经事要忙！”</p><p>And that makes him swell up with pride.<br> 这使他傲气十足。</p><p>But he is not a man — he is a mushroom!&quot;<br> 他简直不象是个人——他是个暴发户！”</p><p>&quot;A what?&quot;<br> “是个什么？”</p><p>&quot;A mushroom!&quot;<br> “是个暴发户！”</p><p>The little prince was now white with rage.<br> 小王子当时气得脸色发白。</p><p>&quot;The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years.<br> 几百万年以来花儿都在制造着刺。</p><p>For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same.<br> 几百万年以来羊仍然在吃花。</p><p>And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns, which are never of any use to them?<br> 要搞清楚为什么花儿费那么大劲给自己制造没有什么用的刺，这难道不是正经事？</p><p>Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important?<br> 难道羊和花之间的战争不重要？</p><p>Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman&#39;s sums?<br> 这难道不比那个大胖子红脸先生的账目更重要？</p><p>And if I know — I, myself — one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet,<br> 如果我自己认识一朵人世间唯一的花，只有我的星球上有它，别的地方都不存在，</p><p>but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing —<br> 而一只小羊胡里胡涂就这样把它一下子毁掉了，</p><p>Oh!

His words were choked by sobbing. The night had fallen.<br> 他无法再说下去了，突然泣不成声。夜幕已经降临。</p><p>I had let my tools drop from my hands.<br> 我放下手中的工具。</p><p>Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death?<br> 我把锤子、螺钉、饥渴、死亡，全都抛在脑后。</p><p>On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted.<br> 在一颗星上，在一颗行星上，在我的行星上，地球上有一个小王子需要安慰！</p><p>I took him in my arms, and rocked him.
