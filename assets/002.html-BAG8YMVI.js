It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.&quot;<br> “那可不是‘东西’。它会飞。那是飞机，是我的飞机。”</p><p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.<br> 我很骄傲地让他知道，我是会飞的。</p><p>He cried out, then: &quot;What!

Which is your planet?&quot;<br> 接着他又说：“那么，你也是从天上来的啦！你是哪个星球上的？”</p><p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: &quot;Do you come from another planet?&quot;<br> 就在那一刻，我仿佛在他身上那层无法揭开的神秘面纱中捕捉到了一丝光亮；于是我突然问道：“你是从另一个星球来的吗？”</p><p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:<br> 可他没有回答。他轻轻摇了摇头，依然目不转睛地盯着我的飞机看：</p><p>&quot;It is true that on that you can&#39;t have come from very far away...&quot;<br> “可不是嘛，靠这个玩意儿，你不可能是从很远的地方来的……”</p><p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time.<br> 说完这句话，他就陷入了长时间的沉思。</p><p>Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.<br> 接着，他从口袋里掏出我画的小羊，沉醉地凝视着他的宝贝。</p><p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the &#39;other planets.&#39;<br> 你可以想象，这种关于“别的星球”模模糊糊的暗示，引起我多么强烈的好奇心。</p><p>I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.<br> 于是我拼命想要从他口中打探出更多的秘密。</p><p>&quot;My little man, where do you come from?<br> “你是从哪里来的，我的小家伙？</p><p>What is this &#39;where I live,&#39; of which you speak?&quot;<br> 你说的‘我住的地方’，到底是哪里啊？”</p><p>&quot;Where do you want to take your sheep?&quot;<br> “你打算把你的小羊带到哪里去呢？”</p><p>After a reflective silence he answered: &quot;The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.&quot;<br> 他沉思了一会儿，然后回答我说：“你给我的那个箱子真好，晚上它可以当作小羊的房子。”</p><p>&quot;That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.&quot;<br> “那当然。如果你乖的话，我还可以给你画一根绳子，这样白天你就能把它拴住，再画一根桩子给你栓它。”</p><p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: &quot;Tie him! What a queer idea!&quot;<br> 可小王子听了这话却像是受了惊：“拴住他！多么奇怪的主意！”</p><p>&quot;But if you don&#39;t tie him,&quot; I said, &quot;he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.&quot;<br> “可如果你不拴住他，”我说，“他就会到处乱跑，然后走丢了。”</p><p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter: &quot;But where do you think he would go?&quot;<br> 我的小朋友又笑了起来：“你以为他能跑到哪里去呀？”</p><p>&quot;Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.&quot;<br> “哪儿都行，他会一直往前走。”</p><p>Then the little prince said, earnestly: &quot;That doesn&#39;t matter.
