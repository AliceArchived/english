Why or why not?</p><p>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t pay someone <strong>just to</strong> deliver bad news for me — at least not in my current situation. Unless I run my own business one day and need to make difficult announcements to employees or customers, I think it&#39;s more <strong>responsible</strong> and <strong>cost-effective</strong> to handle uncomfortable situations myself. As <strong>an ordinary person</strong>, learning to deal with conflict directly is an important life skill, and it also helps me grow <strong>emotionally</strong>.</p><p>就我个人而言，我不会为了传达坏消息而付钱请别人——至少在我目前的生活中不会。除非将来我自己开公司，需要向员工或客户宣布一些棘手的事情，否则我觉得亲自处理不愉快的场面既更负责任，也更省钱。作为普通人，学会直接面对冲突是一项重要的生活技能，也有助于情绪上的成长。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p>Would you pay Lily to deliver your bad news?
