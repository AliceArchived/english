Absolutely not.</p><p>Though I hear your concerns, I completely disagree. I think it&#39;s very important for every young artist to learn to appreciate high-quality things.</p><p>Ms. Newsom, you described your son&#39;s grocery list as &quot;<strong>extravagant</strong>,&quot; but I couldn&#39;t disagree more.</p><p>It&#39;s inspiring that Marshall asked to have caviar instead of spaghetti — not enough children enjoy caviar! Let&#39;s encourage his interest in fine cuisine.</p><p>Mr. Alvarez, you&#39;ve been complaining that Diego has been replacing his 5-year-old sister&#39;s crayon drawings in your house with prints of famous paintings.</p><p>While I understand your concerns, you should be applauding his high standards for art.</p><p>Finally, Mr. Lee, I&#39;m sorry your son threw away his inexpensive <strong>polyester</strong> pyjamas and used your credit card to order silk ones.</p><p>But when he said it was an &quot;emergency,&quot; I must agree —silk pyjamas are the only way to get quality sleep!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Oscar</p><h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="what-do-you-think-about-oscar-s-students-behavior-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-think-about-oscar-s-students-behavior-why"><span>What do you think about Oscar&#39;s students&#39; behavior?
