I spoke politely to the store manager and asked nicely for a refund.</p><p>The manager smiled pleasantly and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but the store policy is very important, and we must follow it.&quot;</p><p>I appreciated her honesty and understood. Rules are rules!</p><p>I also bought a colorful toy for my niece. It was in perfect condition, and it still had the sticker. My niece loved it so much! In fact, I think she loved the sticker more than the toy! So, even if the clock didn&#39;t work, the joy on her face made the visit worth it.</p><p>This store may not offer refunds, but it offers many other things. Sometimes, the experience is worth more than the item. I smiled all the way back home, happy with my new art piece and my niece&#39;s happiness.</p><p>Five stars for this charming store!</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>What do you think of Vikram&#39;s attitude?</strong></p><p>I think Vikram’s attitude shows that he’s a <strong>kind</strong> and <strong>optimistic</strong> person.
