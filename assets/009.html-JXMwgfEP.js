On one hand, pets offer <strong>companionship</strong> — they help reduce stress, loneliness, and even depression. On the other hand, some people keep animals for specific purposes, like dogs for guarding the house or cats to keep mice away. But nowadays, most people treat pets more like family members than animals with a function.</p><p><strong>中文参考：</strong><br> 我认为人们养宠物既是出于情感，也有实用原因。一方面，宠物能带来陪伴，减轻压力和孤独感。另一方面，有些人养狗是为了看家，养猫是为了驱赶老鼠。但现在大多数人更把宠物当成家庭成员来看待，而不是单纯的工具。</p><h4 id="_2-do-you-think-it-s-good-for-children-to-grow-up-with-pets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-do-you-think-it-s-good-for-children-to-grow-up-with-pets"><span>2. <strong>Do you think it&#39;s good for children to grow up with pets?</strong></span></a></h4><p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> Absolutely. Growing up with pets can teach children responsibility, empathy, and patience. When kids help feed or clean up after a pet, they learn to take care of others. Also, pets provide emotional comfort, especially when children are stressed or upset. Of course, parents should supervise to ensure safety and hygiene.</p><p><strong>中文参考：</strong><br> 我完全同意。孩子在宠物的陪伴下成长，可以学到责任感、同理心和耐心。比如孩子帮忙喂食、清洁，就能学会照顾他人。而且宠物还能在孩子情绪低落时给予安慰。当然，父母也需要监督，确保安全与卫生。</p><h4 id="_3-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-keeping-a-pet" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-keeping-a-pet"><span>3. <strong>What are the disadvantages of keeping a pet?</strong></span></a></h4><p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> There are definitely some downsides. Pets require time, money, and attention. You have to feed them, take them to the vet, and sometimes even change your lifestyle around them. Also, some people may suffer from allergies, and pets can occasionally cause damage to furniture or disturb neighbors. It’s a long-term commitment, not just a fun hobby.</p><p><strong>中文参考：</strong><br> 确实有一些缺点。养宠物需要花费时间、金钱和精力。你得喂食、带它们看兽医，有时候还要调整自己的生活方式。此外，有些人可能对宠物过敏，宠物有时也会损坏家具或打扰邻居。这是一项长期承诺，而不仅仅是一个兴趣爱好。</p><h4 id="_4-should-people-be-allowed-to-keep-wild-animals-as-pets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-should-people-be-allowed-to-keep-wild-animals-as-pets"><span>4. <strong>Should people be allowed to keep wild animals as pets?</strong></span></a></h4><p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> I personally think it’s a bad idea. Wild animals have instincts and needs that are hard to meet in a domestic environment. Keeping them as pets is often dangerous for both the animal and the owner. It can also be unethical and harmful to the ecosystem if animals are taken from the wild. I believe only trained professionals, like those in wildlife rescue centers or zoos, should care for them.</p><p><strong>中文参考：</strong><br> 我个人认为这不是一个好主意。野生动物有它们天生的本能和需求，在家庭环境下很难满足。把它们当宠物既对动物不公平，也可能对人造成危险。如果从野外捕捉动物，还会破坏生态系统。我认为只有受过专业训练的人，比如野生动物救助机构或动物园的人员，才应该照顾它们。</p><h4 id="总结答题建议-part-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#总结答题建议-part-3"><span>总结答题建议（Part 3）：</span></a></h4><table><thead><tr><th>技巧</th><th>做法</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>举例说明</td><td>如 &quot;like dogs for guarding the house&quot; 增强说服力</td></tr><tr><td>多角度展开</td><td>情感、成本、安全、道德等角度丰富内容</td></tr><tr><td>使用过渡句</td><td>如 “On one hand…”, “That being said…”, “Of course…” 使逻辑更清晰</td></tr><tr><td>平衡观点</td><td>表达个人观点时适当指出利弊更显成熟</td></tr></tbody></table>',78)]))}const d=t(r,[["render",i]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/F/009.html","title":"Front Window","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Front Window Lily and Zari are watching their new neighbour, Stewart, from Lily's window.
