Why or why not?</strong></p><p>Personally, I don’t agree with Bea’s advice. If Eddy truly wants to find a soulmate, he should <strong>be genuine</strong> and <strong>show his real personality</strong>. Pretending to be someone he’s not might attract the wrong kind of person, and in the long run, that won’t lead to <strong>a meaningful or lasting relationship</strong>. Being <strong>authentic</strong> is always the best way to <strong>build a true connection</strong>.</p><p>我个人并不同意 Bea 的建议。如果 Eddy 真的想找到灵魂伴侣，他就应该真实地展现自己。假装成另一个人可能会吸引到不合适的人，从长远来看，这样的关系既不真诚，也难以长久。做真实的自己，才是建立真正联系的最佳方式。</p><ul><li>genuine: 英 /ˈdʒenjuɪn/, 美 /ˈdʒenjuɪn/ <ul><li>adj. 真实的，真正的；诚恳的</li></ul></li><li>authentic: 英 /ɔːˈθentɪk/, 美 /ɔːˈθentɪk/ <ul><li>adj. 真的, 真正的</li><li>可靠的, 可信的</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>I disagree with Bea’s advice <strong>because I believe</strong> finding a partner is about being with someone who <strong>shares</strong> your lifestyle and <strong>makes</strong> you <strong>feel at ease</strong>. Eddy clearly doesn’t feel comfortable <strong>dressing</strong> formally or <strong>having</strong> deep political conversations. He would be <strong>better off</strong> with someone who enjoys things like exercising and watching movies — activities that <strong>genuinely</strong> match his personality.</p><p>我不同意 Bea 的建议，因为我认为找伴侣应该是找一个和你生活方式相近、让你感到轻松的人。很明显，Eddy 并不喜欢穿正式的衣服或进行严肃的政治讨论。他更适合找一个喜欢锻炼和看电影的人，这些活动更符合他的性格。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Do you agree with Bea&#39;s advice?
