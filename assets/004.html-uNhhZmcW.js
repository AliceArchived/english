As an artist <strong>on a budget</strong>, I was too wise to buy such expensive clothes — until Gerald arrived.</p><p><strong>Gerald</strong>, the most <strong>sophisticated</strong> gallery owner in town, walked in wearing pink pants — just like mine! And his moustache was perfect.</p><p>At that point, I was seriously regretting that I hadn&#39;t spent the usual 60 minutes <strong>grooming</strong> my moustache that morning.</p><p>How embarrassing! I knew that I must not let him see my face, so I desperately grabbed a pair of sunglasses and put them on. Imagine my horror when Gerald walked right towards me!</p><p>&quot;Lovely sunglasses!&quot; he said. &quot;I have a pair just like those.&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#39;t believe that Gerald Klein thought we had the same taste!</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve had these for years,&quot; I said, hoping he wouldn&#39;t see the price tag attached to them.</p><p>Gerald smiled and walked away.</p><p>I hadn&#39;t wanted to purchase the sunglasses, but now I needed to purchase them. Those sunglasses <strong>represented</strong> everything I&#39;d been trying to achieve — sophistication, distinction, style.</p><p>&quot;Those will be $500, please.&quot; the clerk said.</p><p>Sadly, I had to leave the sunglasses and rush out of the store. Although my taste is excellent, my budget is not.</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>Groom: 英 /ɡruːm/, 美 /ɡruːm/ <ul><li>verb [VN] <ul><li>to clean or brush an animal (给动物)擦洗,刷洗: <ul><li>to groom a horse / dog / cat</li></ul></li><li>~ sb (for / as sth) to prepare or train sb for an important job or position 使作好准备；培养；训练: <ul><li>Our junior employees are being <strong>groomed</strong> for more senior roles. 我们的初级雇员正在接受培训以承担更重要的职责。</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>noun [C] <ul><li>a bridegroom 新郎</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sophistication: 品味高雅</li><li>Distinction: 优秀</li></ul><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>While both &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary Entry&quot; and &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary&quot; are understandable, &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary Entry&quot; is generally preferred for a specific date because: <ul><li><strong>Clarity:</strong> &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary Entry&quot; clearly indicates that what follows is a single entry within a larger diary. &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary&quot; could refer to the entire collection of entries, spanning multiple days or even years.</li><li><strong>Context:</strong> When you see &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary Entry, May 16th,&quot; it immediately tells you that this is what Oscar wrote on that specific date. &quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary&quot; alone doesn&#39;t provide that immediate context.</li></ul></li><li>Think of it like this: <ul><li>&quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary&quot; is like the title of a book (the whole diary).</li><li>&quot;Oscar&#39;s Diary Entry&quot; is like the title of a chapter within that book (a specific day&#39;s writing).</li></ul></li><li>作为一个预算有限的艺术家，我太明智了以至于没有买这么贵的衣服。 <ul><li>As an artist on a budget, I was too <strong>wise</strong> to buy such expensive clothes.</li></ul></li><li>杰拉尔德是城里最老练的画廊老板，他走了进来，穿着粉红色的裤子——和我的一模一样！他的胡子也完美无缺。 <ul><li>Gerald, the most sophisticated gallery owner in town, walked in wearing pink pants — just like mine!
