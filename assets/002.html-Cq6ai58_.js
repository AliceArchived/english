Building friendships <strong>starts</strong> with treating others kindly and showing some empathy.</p><p>在我看来，Justin 看起来有些自私 — 他并不怎么关心周围的人，这也许能解释他为什么会感到孤独。如果他想真正交到朋友，就需要更体贴一点，别那么粗鲁。建立友谊的关键，是要善待他人，并展现出一些同理心。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Can you describe Justin?
