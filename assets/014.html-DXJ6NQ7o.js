You can also write an amazing memoir if you follow these simple, Lin-approved tips.</p><p><strong>Create the Right Environment</strong></p><p>What would you say are the essential things you need to write a book? A desk, a pen, and a notebook, right?</p><p>Wrong! You only need an inspiring music playlist.</p><p>A carefully selected playlist will remind you of important moments in your life and provide a nice soundtrack for doing things other than writing too.</p><p>Creating the perfect playlist could take anywhere from a few hours to several years, but you can&#39;t write without one.</p><p><strong>Get the Right Writing Tools</strong></p><p>Even with an incredible playlist, you&#39;ll actually still need a pen and paper.</p><p>With the right pen, the memoir will basically write itself. And what kind of pen would be best? Well, you&#39;ll want to try at least seventy-eight before you make that decision.</p><p>You also need hundreds of notebooks even if you&#39;ve never filled up a single one. That way, if inspiration does come, you can grab one of your many blank notebooks.</p><p><strong>Keep a Writing Schedule</strong></p><p>With a schedule, you won&#39;t feel guilty when you&#39;re not writing. I schedule one day of writing a month.</p><p>During the other 27-30 days, I enjoy my life - while telling everyone I meet that I&#39;m writing a memoir.</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>也许我的生活看起来没什么特别的，但实际上，我是一名严肃的作家，正在撰写一本即将获奖的回忆录，讲述我许多<strong>引人入胜</strong>的经历。 <ul><li>It might not seem like there&#39;s much happening in my life, but I&#39;m actually a serious writer working on a soon-to-be award-winning memoir about my many fascinating experiences.</li></ul></li><li>精心挑选的播放列表不仅能让你回忆起人生中的重要时刻，还能为你在写作之外的其他活动提供美妙的背景音乐。 <ul><li>A carefully selected playlist will remind you of important moments in your life and provide a nice soundtrack for doing things other than writing too.</li></ul></li><li>制作完美的播放列表可能需要从几小时到几年的时间，但没有它，你就无法写作。 <ul><li>Creating the perfect playlist could take <strong>anywhere</strong> from a few hours to several years, but you can&#39;t write without one.</li><li>制作完美的播放列表可能需要从几小时到几年的时间，但没有它，你就无法写作。</li><li>The word <strong>&quot;anywhere&quot;</strong> is used to emphasize the <strong>range of time</strong> required.
