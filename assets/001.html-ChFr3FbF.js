Why?</strong></p><h4 id="support-lily" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-lily"><span>Support Lily</span></a></h4><p>I agree with Lily, but for a slightly different reason. I think that if students aren’t naturally talented in music, they shouldn’t be required to study it. Forcing them to do so could lead to frustration and poor results. It’s also unfair to others who have to sit through off-key performances. In my view, it’s more beneficial for students to focus their efforts on areas where they show real potential.</p><p>我同意 Lily 的观点，但理由稍有不同。我认为如果学生在音乐方面没有天赋，就不应该强迫他们学习音乐。强迫他们这样做可能会导致挫败感和糟糕的表现，也对其他不得不听走调表演的人不公平。在我看来，学生更应该把精力投入到自己真正擅长的领域。</p><h4 id="support-zari" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-zari"><span>Support Zari</span></a></h4><p>I agree with Zari because I believe that learning music has value beyond just talent. Music education can improve concentration, creativity, and emotional expression. Even if a student <strong>isn&#39;t naturally gifted</strong>, the experience of learning an instrument can still be meaningful and enjoyable. Not everything we learn has to lead to <strong>mastery</strong> — sometimes, the process itself is <strong>worthwhile</strong>.</p><p>我支持 Zari 的观点，因为我认为学习音乐的价值不仅仅在于天赋。音乐教育可以提升专注力、创造力以及情感表达能力。即使一个学生没有天赋，学习乐器的过程也依然可以是有意义且令人享受的。我们学习的东西不一定都要成为专家，有时候，学习的过程本身就很有价值。</p><ul><li>mastery: 英 /ˈmɑːstəri/, 美 /ˈmæstəri/ <ul><li>n. 精通；优势；统治权；征服；掌握</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Do you agree with Lily or with Zari?
