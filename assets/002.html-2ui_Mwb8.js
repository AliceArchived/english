The singer was so surprised that she <strong>sang</strong> a <strong>super high note</strong> — so high that it broke wine glasses! The audience loved it and started clapping loudly.

The audience responded with loud <strong>applause</strong> and <strong>laughter</strong>, completely entertained by the chaos. I found this scene especially memorable because it transformed what was supposed to be a serious opera into something surprisingly <strong>comedic</strong> and <strong>delightful</strong>. It was also amusing to see how <strong>even</strong> Oscar, who was initially upset, ended up admitting that it was the best performance he&#39;d ever seen from that singer.</p><p>我最喜欢的情节是糖糖这只青蛙在演出中突然从歌剧演员的帽子里跳出来。那位歌手被吓了一跳，唱出了一个震碎酒杯的高音，观众们爆发出热烈的掌声和笑声。这个场景让我印象特别深刻，因为它让原本严肃的歌剧变得又滑稽又有趣。更好笑的是，一开始生气的奥斯卡最后竟然承认，这是他见过这位歌手最精彩的一次演出。</p><ul><li>leap: 英 /liːp/ 美 /liːp/ <ul><li><strong>leapt</strong>, <strong>leapt</strong> / lept / or <strong>leaped</strong>, <strong>leaped</strong></li><li>vi. 跳，跳跃</li><li>n. 跳跃；飞跃</li><li>vt. 跳跃，跳过；使跃过</li></ul></li><li>startle: 英 /ˈstɑːtl/ 美 /ˈstɑːrtl/ <ul><li>vt. 使吓一跳；使惊奇</li><li>vi. 惊吓；惊跳；惊奇</li><li>n. 惊愕；惊恐</li></ul></li><li>shatter: 英 /ˈʃætə(r)/ 美 /ˈʃætər/ <ul><li>vt. 打碎；破掉；使散开；粉碎；破坏</li><li>vi. 粉碎；损坏；落叶</li><li>n. 碎片；乱七八糟的状态</li></ul></li><li>comedic: 英 /kə&#39;miːdɪk/ 美 /kə&#39;midɪk/ <ul><li>adj. 喜剧的</li></ul></li></ul>',39)]))}const h=t(n,[["render",a]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/O/002.html","title":"Opera Frog - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Opera Frog - B2 Eddy and his son, Junior, meet their neighbor Oscar in the lobby of the opera house.
