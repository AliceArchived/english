In fact, it was Betsy who played the prank, but the teacher became so angry that he threatened to punish the entire class. So Junior took responsibility to <strong>stop</strong> that <strong>from</strong> happening.</p><p>Junior 说他把青蛙放进老师的桌子里，是因为他想保护 Betsy。实际上，是 Betsy 搞的恶作剧，但老师非常生气，甚至威胁要惩罚全班。于是 Junior 主动承担了责任，以阻止这种情况发生。</p><hr><p><strong>In this story, Betsy tells Junior that he is very brave. Describe the personality of someone in your family or of a friend.</strong></p><p>My uncle isn&#39;t exactly a brave person — in fact, he&#39;s quite the opposite. Outwardly, he comes across as agreeable and tends to go along with whatever others say. But when it comes to family matters, he always wants to take control.</p><p>The main issue is that he avoids taking real responsibility. If something goes wrong, he rarely reflects on his own actions and instead blames others. Although he likes the idea of being in charge, he struggles to deal with the pressure and consequences that come with leadership.</p><p>我的叔叔并不是一个特别勇敢的人 —— 事实上，他正好相反。在外人面前，他表现得很随和，常常附和别人的观点。但在家庭中，他总是想掌控一切。</p><p>问题在于，他经常逃避真正的责任。如果事情出了问题，他很少反省自己的行为，反而倾向于责怪别人。虽然他喜欢当领导的感觉，但他却难以应对随之而来的压力和后果。</p><h4 id="_1-describing-a-supportive-friend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-describing-a-supportive-friend"><span>1.
