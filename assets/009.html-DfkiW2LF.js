She checked in only 15 minutes before the flight <strong>was scheduled to depart</strong>, <strong>which</strong> wasn’t enough time for the airline to <strong>process</strong> her luggage. As a result, they let her <strong>board</strong> the plane, but her suitcase had to <strong>stay behind</strong>. To solve this problem, Bea cleverly put on all the <strong>clothes</strong> from her suitcase and left the <strong>now-empty bag</strong> at the airport. That was a smart and creative solution.</p><p>Bea 没能托运行李，因为她到机场时太晚了。她在航班预定起飞前 15 分钟才办理登机手续，航空公司已经来不及处理她的行李。于是他们让她登机，但她的行李只能留在机场。为了解决这个问题，Bea 机智地把箱子里的所有衣服都穿在身上，然后把空箱子留在了机场。这真是一个聪明又有创意的做法。</p><hr><p><strong>Bea packed a lot of clothes! In your opinion, what is better, traveling light or traveling with many things? Why?</strong></p><p>Personally, I prefer traveling with more things. I find it more comfortable to have everything I might need, especially when it comes to clothes or <strong>personal items</strong>. If I <strong>pack too lightly</strong>, I often feel unprepared or uncomfortable. Honestly, if I can’t bring what I need, I’d rather not travel at all.</p><p>就我个人而言，我更喜欢带多一点东西去旅行。我觉得这样更舒服，特别是当涉及到衣物或个人用品时。如果我带得太少，往往会感到不方便或不安心。说实话，如果不能带上需要的东西，我宁愿不去旅行。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why couldn&#39;t Bea check her bag?</strong></p><p>Bea couldn&#39;t / too late / check her</p><p>Bea couldn&#39;t check her bag because she checked in too late.
