For me, the most fascinating part would be learning about the ship’s history — especially how it sank and how people responded during the disaster. I find those real-life survival stories incredibly moving. Also, I think it’s great that the exhibit includes interactive parts for kids, like tracking specific details. That kind of hands-on activity makes learning more memorable and enjoyable, not just for children, but for adults as well.</p><p>我觉得这个展览非常引人入胜。对我来说，最吸引人的部分是了解这艘船的历史，特别是它是如何沉没的，以及人们在灾难中是如何应对的。我觉得这种真实的求生故事特别感人。另外，我认为展览中还有互动部分也很棒，比如让孩子们追踪细节。这种动手参与的方式不仅让孩子们学得更深刻，也让大人觉得更有趣。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What part of the exhibit would you enjoy most?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I think/ For me, / The best part</p><p>I think the exhibit is fun.
