However, soon I realized that it was just a surprise birthday party. This was especially surprising for me because my birthday is next month!</p><p>I was very moved by <strong>everyone&#39;s contributions to</strong> make this party special. When I saw the single balloon tied to a chair, I knew that my granddaughter Lin must have been in charge of decorations. (&quot;everyone&#39;s <strong>efforts</strong> to make this party special&quot;, Efforts” fits better here; “contributions to make” is a bit awkward.)</p><p>It was perfect because cleaning up at the end of the night was incredibly easy!</p><p>As I came to find out, Eddy was in charge of food, which explains why there was only a single bag of <strong>stale</strong> potato chips.</p><p>Everyone likes watching other people play video games, so I know we all enjoyed the Space Zombies tournament that Junior organized. However, it was only a single game, so no one other than Junior got a chance to play.</p><p>I also really appreciated the lovely single bottle of wine Oscar brought to the party and the extremely <strong>informative</strong> two-hour lecture he gave about the wine&#39;s origins.</p><p>I was worried that I was going to have to tell everyone to leave at the end of the night, but thanks to Oscar&#39;s lecture, everyone left <strong>voluntarily</strong>!</p><p>Thank you all for making me feel so loved. I had such a great time that I&#39;m throwing myself another birthday party on my actual birthday next month!</p><p>See you there!</p><p>Lucy</p><h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="whose-contribution-to-the-party-was-the-worst-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#whose-contribution-to-the-party-was-the-worst-why"><span>Whose contribution to the party was the worst?

He only brought one bottle of wine and gave a two-hour lecture about where it came from. <strong>Instead of</strong> making the party more fun, his long speech made everyone leave early. It wasn’t really a good way to celebrate Lucy’s birthday.</p><p>我认为 Oscar 的贡献最糟糕。他只带来了一瓶酒，还花了两个小时讲述酒的来历。他的冗长演讲让大家提前离开了派对，而不是让派对更有趣。这并不是庆祝 Lucy 生日的好方式。</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>stale: 英 /steɪl/,美 /steɪl/ <strong>adjective</strong><ol><li>(of food, especially bread and cake 食物,尤指面包和糕点) no longer fresh and therefore unpleasant to eat<br> 不新鲜的</li><li>(of air, smoke, etc. 空气、烟等) no longer fresh; smelling unpleasant<br> 不新鲜的；(空气)污浊的；(烟味)难闻的:</li><li>stale cigarette smoke<br> 难闻的烟味儿</li><li>stale sweat<br> 汗臭味</li><li>something that is <strong>stale</strong> has been said or done too many times before and is no longer interesting or exciting<br> 陈腐的；没有新意的；老掉牙的: <ol><li>stale jokes<br> 老掉牙的笑话</li><li>Their marriage had <strong>gone stale</strong>.<br> 他们的婚姻已了无热情。</li></ol></li><li>a person who is <strong>stale</strong> has done the same thing for too long and so is unable to do it well or produce any new ideas<br> (因持续做某事时间太长)厌倦的,腻烦的: <ol><li>After two years in the job, she felt stale and needed a change.<br> 在那个岗位干了十年之后,她觉得腻了,需要换换工作。</li></ol></li><li><strong>stale·ness</strong> <em>noun</em> <strong>[U]</strong></li></ol></li></ul>',27)]))}const p=t(n,[["render",s]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/duolingo/story/T/005.html","title":"Thanks for the Memories - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Thanks for the Memories - B2 From: Lucy@duomail.co To: neighbors@duomail.co Subject: Thanks for the Memories My dear friends, When I walked into my apartment and saw all of you ...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Thanks for the Memories - B2\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-07-29T22:34:10.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/AliceArchived\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://alicearchived.github.io/english/duolingo/story/T/005.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"English Study Record"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Thanks for the Memories - B2"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Thanks for the Memories - B2 From: Lucy@duomail.co To: neighbors@duomail.co Subject: Thanks for the Memories My dear friends, When I walked into my apartment and saw all of you ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-07-29T22:34:10.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"story"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Duolingo"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"English"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-07-29T22:34:10.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1753828450000,"updatedTime":1753828450000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice","username":"Alice","email":"alys8715ia@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alice"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.8,"words":841},"filePathRelative":"duolingo/story/T/005.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>From: <a href=\\"mailto:Lucy@duomail.co\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Lucy@duomail.co</a></p>\\n<p>To: <a href=\\"mailto:neighbors@duomail.co\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">neighbors@duomail.co</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Subject: Thanks for the Memories</strong></p>\\n<p>My dear friends,</p>","autoDesc":true}');export{p as comp,c as data};
