However, when one of the students threatened to throw red paint on him to <strong>protest</strong> the fur industry, he immediately <strong>confessed</strong> the truth. This <strong>twist</strong> at the end made the story both entertaining and meaningful, as it touched on issues like <strong>vanity</strong>, <strong>peer pressure</strong>, and <strong>animal rights</strong> in a light-hearted way.</p><p>是的，我非常喜欢这个故事。我觉得 Oscar 的行为既有趣又带点讽刺。他穿着一件假皮草外套，却假装是真的，只是为了让别人羡慕他。但当一位学生威胁要向他泼红漆以抗议皮草产业时，他立刻坦白了真相。这个结局令人惊喜又有深意，因为它以轻松的方式涉及了虚荣、同辈压力和动物权益等议题。</p>',43)]))}const u=o(a,[["render",n]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/S/001.html","title":"Save the Animals","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Save the Animals Oscar is walking into the school where he works.
