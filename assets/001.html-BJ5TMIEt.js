I heard from some colleagues that parking is nightmare for you. Well, worry no more!</p><p>I planned and helped construct a new parking garage in our neighborhood! According to my map, it&#39;s right near your building. Now, instead of getting lost and stressed, you can just drive in and park easily.</p><p>And have you seen the zones? There are special zones for pedestrians to keep you safe. I also set up bright signs to show you where to turn left and right. It&#39;s like a fun driving game! Just don&#39;t speed, or you might get a ticket!</p><p>I know you didn&#39;t ask for it, but I thought it would be an exciting surprise. Now, you won&#39;t have to leave home easly or get stuck in traffic. There can&#39;t be any more parking issues for you!</p><p>You&#39;re welcome!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Bea</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>What are your thoughts on Bea&#39;s surprise?</strong></p><p>I think Bea’s surprise was incredibly thoughtful.
