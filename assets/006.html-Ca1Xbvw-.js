It was part of a story where she and her friend Lily <strong>took on a ghost-hunting job</strong>. In her log, Zari described going to a house where strange things were <strong>happening</strong>. She expected to find the spirits of two lovers, like in the romance novels she had read. But things <strong>took</strong> an unexpected <strong>turn</strong>.</p><p>When she and Lily arrived at the house, Zari realized, to her horror, that it actually belonged to Troy, the most popular boy at her school—and also the boy she secretly had a crush on. She was <strong>mortified</strong> to be caught vacuuming his house in the middle of the night, especially since their ghost-catching machine was really just her dad’s vacuum cleaner.</p><p>Surprisingly, instead of laughing at them, Troy was actually <strong>thrilled</strong> to see them. He <strong>admitted</strong> that he was terrified of ghosts and even gave them a hug. Zari was so relieved and excited that she ended her log by saying she would have to come back once a week to “keep the ghosts away,” clearly happy that Troy was now her first real customer.</p><p>I found her log funny, creative, and very <strong>relatable</strong>. It showed how something embarrassing can turn into a great memory—and possibly even the start of something more.</p><p><strong>[Chinese]</strong><br> 我最近读到的一篇很有趣的日志是一个叫扎丽的女孩写的。她和朋友莉莉接了一次“猎鬼任务”，并在日志中记录了整个经历。她原本以为会遇到像小说中那种被家庭拆散的幽灵情侣，但事情却发生了意想不到的变化。</p><p>她们到达目的地后，扎丽发现那竟然是她暗恋的校草特洛伊的家，这让她当场吓坏了。更糟糕的是，她正在用她爸的吸尘器“捉鬼”，场面十分尴尬。</p><p>不过没想到，特洛伊并没有嘲笑她们，反而非常高兴地表示他害怕鬼，并且还给了她们一个拥抱。扎丽在日志最后写道她要每周回来一次“驱鬼”，显然是很高兴能拥有这样一个梦幻的新客户。</p><p>我觉得这篇日志又搞笑又有创意，还很真实。它让我觉得，即使是尴尬的经历，有时也能变成美好的回忆，甚至是一段故事的开始。</p><p><strong>take on</strong> vs <strong>take</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>take on</strong>（更完整、更自然）</p><ul><li><p><strong>含义</strong>：承担、接受（某项任务、责任、挑战）</p></li><li><p><strong>语气</strong>：更正式、有“主动承担某事”的语气</p></li><li><p><strong>用法</strong>：适合描述<strong>工作、任务、项目、挑战等</strong></p></li></ul></li></ol><p><em>Zari and Lily <strong>took on</strong> a ghost-hunting job.</em><br> → 她们主动接受了这项猎鬼任务（强调“承担挑战”）。</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>take</strong>（简单接受/拿到）</p><ul><li><p><strong>含义</strong>：接受、选择、拿到</p></li><li><p><strong>语气</strong>：中性，更普通</p></li><li><p><strong>更常用于</strong>课程（take a class）、药物（take medicine）等</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>❌ <em>Zari <strong>took</strong> a ghost-hunting job</em><br> → 虽然语法上可以，但<strong>语气不够自然</strong>，尤其用于任务或工作时，<strong>缺少“主动应战”的感觉</strong>。</p><table><thead><tr><th>动词短语</th><th>含义</th><th>例句</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>take on a job</strong></td><td>承担一份工作</td><td>She took on a part-time job to support her studies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>take a job</strong></td><td>接受一份工作</td><td>He took a job offer from Google.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>take on a challenge</strong></td><td>接受挑战</td><td>I&#39;m ready to take on this new challenge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>take a class</strong></td><td>上一门课</td><td>I&#39;m taking a math class this semester.</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>结论：<br> 在描述 “猎鬼任务” 这种带有主动行动、挑战性的场景时，<br> “take on a ghost-hunting job” 更地道、更有画面感。</p></blockquote><p>But things took an unexpected turn.</p><p>为什么不能说 “But things took an unexpected.”<br> 这是不完整的句子，因为：</p><ul><li>“unexpected” 是形容词，后面必须修饰名词。</li><li>“take” 在这里是动词，后面必须接一个名词宾语（take + something）。</li></ul><p>“take an unexpected” ← 错误，因为缺少名词<br> ✅ 正确的是：<br> “take an unexpected turn” ✅</p><p>“take a turn” 是固定搭配： take a turn = 情况发生变化</p><ul><li>“an unexpected turn” = 一个意想不到的转折 / 变化</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>表达</th><th>中文意思</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The story took a dramatic turn.</td><td>故事发生了戏剧性的转折。</td></tr><tr><td>Things took a dark turn.</td><td>情况突然变糟了。</td></tr><tr><td>Their conversation took a serious turn.</td><td>他们的谈话变得严肃起来。</td></tr><tr><td>The trip took an unexpected turn.</td><td>这次旅行出现了意外的变化。</td></tr></tbody></table><p>“mortified” vs “worried”</p><table><thead><tr><th>词汇</th><th>词性</th><th>中文含义</th><th>强度</th><th>适用场景</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>mortified</strong></td><td>形容词</td><td>极度尴尬、羞愧</td><td>强烈</td><td>丢脸、尴尬、社死级别的情境</td></tr><tr><td><strong>worried</strong></td><td>形容词</td><td>担心、焦虑</td><td>中等偏弱</td><td>担心后果、健康、任务未完成等</td></tr></tbody></table>',54)]))}const l=e(n,[["render",s]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/G/006.html","title":"Ghost Hunting Log -
