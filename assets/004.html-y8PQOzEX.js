I am glad!&quot;<br> “啊，我真高兴。”</p><p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes.<br> 我不明白羊吃小灌木这件事为什么如此重要。</p><p>But the little prince added: &quot;Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?&quot;<br> 可小王子又说道：“那么，它们也吃猴面包树喽？”</p><p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.<br> 我对小王子说，猴面包树可不是小灌木，相反的，它们是像城堡那么大的大树；即便是他带回一群大象，也啃不完一棵猴面包树。</p><p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.<br> 一群大象这种想法使小王子笑了起来。</p><p>&quot;We would have to put them one on top of the other,&quot; he said.<br> “那可得把这些大象一只叠一只地垒起来。”他说。</p><p>But he made a wise comment: &quot;Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.&quot;<br> 但他很有见识地说：“猴面包树在长大之前，开始也是很小的。”</p><p>&quot;That is strictly correct,&quot; I said. &quot;But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?&quot;<br> “这非常对，”我说道，“可是为什么你想叫你的羊去吃小猴面包树呢？”</p><p>He answered me at once, &quot;Oh, come, come!&quot;, as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident.<br> 他立即回答我道：“唉！这还用说！”似乎他说的是不言而喻的事情。</p><p>And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.<br> 可是我自己不得不在没有任何帮助的情况下费很大的心劲来解决这个问题。</p><p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived — as on all planets — good plants and bad plants.<br> 事实上，据我所知，在小王子所住的星球，就像其他所有星球上一样，有好的植物也有坏的植物。</p><p>In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible.<br> 因此，也就有有益植物的种子和有害植物的种子，可是种子是看不见的。</p><p>They sleep deep in the heart of the earth&#39;s darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.<br> 它们沉睡在泥土黑暗的深处，直到它们当中的某一粒忽然想要苏醒过来。</p><p>Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin — timidly at first — to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun.<br> 于是这个小种子就会伸展开身子，开始腼腆地、毫无害处地朝着太阳长出一棵秀丽可爱的小嫩苗。</p><p>If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish.<br> 如果它只是小萝卜的嫩芽或是玫瑰的嫩苗，就让它自由自在地生长。</p><p>But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.<br> 如果是一棵坏苗，在辨认出来它的那一刻，就应该尽快把它拔掉。</p><p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and those were the seeds of the baobab.<br> 因为在小王子曾经居住的星球上，有些非常可怕的种子；那就是猴面包树的种子。</p><p>The soil of that planet was infested with them.<br> 在那里的泥土里，这种种子多得成灾。</p><p>A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.<br> 一棵猴面包树苗，假如你拔得太迟，就再也无法把它清除掉。</p><p>It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots.<br> 它就会盘踞整个星球。它的树根能把星球钻透。</p><p>And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...<br> 如果星球很小，而猴面包树很多，它就把整个星球搞得支离破碎。</p><p>&quot;It is a question of discipline,&quot; the little prince said to me later on.<br> “这是个纪律问题。”小王子后来向我解释道。</p><p>&quot;When you&#39;ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care.<br> “当你早上梳洗完毕以后，必须同样仔细地给你的星球梳洗。</p><p>You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth.<br> 你必须留意着自己要定时去拔掉猴面包树苗。这种树苗小的时候与玫瑰苗差不多，一旦可以把它们区别开的时候，就要把它拔掉。</p><p>It is very tedious work,&quot; the little prince added, &quot;but very easy.&quot;<br> “这是一件非常乏味的工作，但很容易。”小王子补充道。</p><p>And one day he said to me: &quot;You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is.<br> 有一天，他对我说：“你应该用心地画一副漂亮的图画，这样你们家乡的孩子们能清楚地知道整个是什么样子的。</p><p>That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.&quot;<br> 如果将来有一天他们出外旅行，这对他们是很有用的。”</p><p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; he added, &quot;there is no harm in putting off some work until another day.<br> “有时候，”他还对我说，“人们把自己的工作推到以后去做，并没有什么妨害。”</p><p>But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.<br> 但是遇到拔猴面包树苗这种事，那就意味着造成大灾难。</p><p>I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes...&quot;<br> 我遇到过一个星球，上面住着一个懒家伙，他放过了三棵小树苗 ⋯⋯”</p><p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet.<br> 于是，根据小王子的描述，我把这个星球画了下来。</p><p>I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist.<br> 我从来不大愿意以道德家的口吻来说话。</p><p>But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood,<br> 可是猴面包树的危险，大家都了解得太少，</p><p>and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid,<br> 对迷失在小行星上的人来说，危险性非常之大，</p><p>that for once I am breaking through my reserve.<br> 因此这一回，我贸然打破了我的这种（不喜欢教训人的）惯例。</p><p>&quot;Children,&quot; I say plainly, &quot;watch out for the baobabs!&quot;<br> 我说：“孩子们，要当心那些猴面包树呀！”</p><p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.<br> 他们同我一样，长期以来绕开了这种危险，却没有意识到它的危险性。所以我花了很大的功夫画这副画是为了他们。</p><p>The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.<br> 我通过这种方式传递的教训，值得我所花费的所有功夫。</p><p>Perhaps you will ask me, &quot;Why are there no other drawings in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?&quot;<br> 你们也许要问，为什么这本书中别的画都没有这副猴面包树的画那么壮观呢？</p><p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful.<br> 答案很简单：我试过了，别的画我没能成功。</p><p>When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.<br> 而当我画猴面包树时，有一种急切的心情在激励着我。</p>',48)]))}const l=t(i,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/reading/prince/004.html","title":"Chapter 04","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Writing"],"tag":["小王子"],"toc":true,"description":"Chapter 04 As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. 每天我都从我们的谈话中了解到一些关于小王子的星球，他的出走和旅行等事情。 Th...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Chapter 04\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/AliceArchived\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://alicearchived.github.io/english/reading/prince/004.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"English Study Record"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Chapter 04"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Chapter 04 As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. 每天我都从我们的谈话中了解到一些关于小王子的星球，他的出走和旅行等事情。 Th..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"小王子"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1754277032000,"updatedTime":1754277032000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice","username":"Alice","email":"alys8715ia@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alice"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":6.81,"words":2044},"filePathRelative":"reading/prince/004.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey.<br>\\n每天我都从我们的谈话中了解到一些关于小王子的星球，他的出走和旅行等事情。</p>\\n<p>The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts.<br>\\n这些信息都是偶然从他的各种反应中慢慢得到的。</p>\\n<p>It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.<br>\\n就这样，第三天我就了解到关于猴面包树的悲剧。</p>","autoDesc":true}`);export{l as comp,d as data};
