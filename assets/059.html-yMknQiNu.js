However, the oven <strong>emits</strong> a strong <strong>fishy</strong> smell, attracting stray cats into the bakery. When Lin attempts to mask the <strong>odor</strong> with air freshener while the oven is still on, it <strong>catches fire</strong>. A repairman later informs them that fixing the oven will cost $1,000, <strong>effectively negating any initial savings</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, Lin&#39;s attempt to save money by buying a used oven ultimately results in higher expenses due to repair costs and the <strong>complications</strong> caused by the oven&#39;s condition.</p><p>故事中，Lin 为面包店买了一个二手烤箱，声称比新的便宜了 500 美元。然而，这个烤箱散发出强烈的鱼腥味，引来了流浪猫。当林试图在烤箱还开着时用空气清新剂掩盖气味时，烤箱起火了。维修工随后告诉他们，修理烤箱将花费 1000 美元，等于把最初节省的钱全赔进去了。</p><p>因此，Lin 为了省钱而购买二手烤箱的做法最终导致了更高的开销，因为除了维修费用外，还要应对烤箱状况带来的各种麻烦。</p><h4 id="effectively-negating" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#effectively-negating"><span>Effectively negating</span></a></h4><p>The phrase &quot;effectively negating&quot; means &quot;in practice, canceling out&quot; or &quot;making something meaningless or useless.&quot;</p><p>“Effectively negating” = 实际上等于把……抵消了 / 把……白费了</p><blockquote><p>effectively negating any initial savings<br> = 实际上把最初节省的开支全抵消了<br> = 等于一开始省的钱都白省了</p></blockquote><h4 id="complications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#complications"><span>complications</span></a></h4><p>The word &quot;complications&quot; refers to <strong>unexpected problems or difficulties</strong> that make a situation more complex or harder to deal with.</p><ul><li>complications = 并发的问题 / 额外的麻烦 / 复杂情况</li><li>In this context: <ul><li>complications = 烤箱状态引起的额外问题，比如味道难闻、吸引流浪猫、引发火灾等</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>complications caused by the oven&#39;s condition<br> = 由于烤箱状况引发的额外问题</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>emit: 英 /iˈmɪt/, 美 /iˈmɪt/ <ul><li>vt. 发出，放射；发行；发表</li></ul></li><li>fishy: 英 /&#39;fɪʃɪ/, 美 /&#39;fɪʃi/ <ul><li>adj. 鱼的；似鱼的；可疑的；呆滞的</li></ul></li><li>odor: 英 /ˈəʊdə/, 美 /ˈodɚ/ <ul><li>n. 气味；名声</li></ul></li><li>negate: 英 /nɪˈɡeɪt/, 美 /nɪˈɡeɪt/ <ul><li>vt. 取消，使无效</li><li>否定；否认</li></ul></li><li>complication: 英 /ˌkɒmplɪˈkeɪʃn/, 美 /ˌkɑːmplɪˈkeɪʃn/ <ul><li>n.
