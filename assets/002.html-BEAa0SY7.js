Lucy insists they stay, but not just for the tea — she nudges Lin to talk to the cute barista.</li><li><strong>Underneath</strong>: Lucy, the grandmother, is gently pushing Lin to be open to new experiences — in this case, maybe flirting, taking a small romantic risk, or just getting out of their comfort zone.</li><li><strong>Twist</strong>: At the end, it’s revealed Lucy had an ulterior motive — she <em>knew</em> there was a sandwich place and could’ve taken Lin there, but she chose this café instead. That hints she had planned the moment as a kind of gentle matchmaking or confidence-boosting nudge.</li></ul><p>So while it may seem weird or random at first, the core message is:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sometimes people who care about us push us to pause, notice others, and take a small emotional risk — like talking to someone new.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The weirdness adds to the charm — a grandma encouraging flirting over tea is unusual, but memorable.</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why did Lucy want to stay at the café?</strong></p><p>Lucy chose to stay at the café because she wanted to give Lin a chance to talk to the barista on her own.</p><p>Lucy 选择留在咖啡馆，是因为她想给 Lin 一个机会，让她自己去和咖啡师交流。</p><hr><p>Lucy wanted to stay at the café because she hoped to encourage Lin to talk to the barista on her own. From the way <strong>the story unfolds</strong>, it’s clear that Lucy saw an opportunity for Lin to take initiative and possibly start a connection with someone she liked. Instead of pushing her directly, Lucy stepped back in a subtle way — staying behind gave Lin the space and confidence to approach the barista without feeling pressured. I think Lucy was being thoughtful and supportive by creating the right moment for her friend.</p><p>Lucy 想留在咖啡馆，是因为她希望鼓励 Lin 自己去和咖啡师说话。从故事发展的方式来看，Lucy 显然是察觉到了 Lin 的心思，希望她能够主动迈出第一步，或许还能建立某种联系。Lucy 并没有直接施压，而是用一种很巧妙的方式选择退后一步 — 留下来，给了 Lin 一个可以放松、鼓起勇气开口的空间。我觉得 Lucy 这个做法很体贴，也很支持朋友，是在帮她创造一个合适的机会。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why did Lucy want to stay at the café?</strong></p><p>Lucy wanted / because / the barista</p><p>Lucy wanted to stay at the café because she wanted Lin to talk <strong>to</strong> the barista first.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote>',35)]))}const c=e(o,[["render",s]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duo-story/T/002.html","title":"Tea and a Chance - B3","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Tea and a Chance - B3 Lucy and Lin stop by a small neighborhood café on their walk.
