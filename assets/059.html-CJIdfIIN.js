I <strong>strongly believe</strong> that our health is <strong>closely connected to</strong> the habits we <strong>form</strong>, and high school <strong>plays a key role</strong> in <strong>shaping</strong> those habits. It’s during these formative years that students start to take more responsibility for their lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, and sleep. Ignoring this stage could lead to poor habits that are difficult to change later in life. So, I believe Lily’s opinion underestimates the importance of habit-building in <strong>adolescence</strong>.</p><p>我并不认同 Lily 对健康的看法。我坚信我们的健康与所养成的习惯密切相关，而高中阶段在塑造这些习惯方面起着关键作用。在这个形成性阶段，学生开始对自己的生活方式负责，比如饮食、锻炼和睡眠。如果忽视这一阶段，可能会导致形成难以改变的不良习惯。因此，我认为 Lily 的观点低估了青春期培养习惯的重要性。</p><hr><ul><li>formative: 英 /&#39;fɔːmətɪv/, 美 /&#39;fɔːrmətɪv/ <ul><li>adj. 形成的；造型的；格式化的；（对某人或某事发展）有重大影响的</li><li>n. 构词要素</li></ul></li><li>adolescence: 英 /ˌædə&#39;lesns/, 美 /ˌædə&#39;lesns/ <ul><li>n. 青春期(一般指成年以前由 13 至 15 的发育期)</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>How do you feel about Lily&#39;s opinion on health?</strong></p><p>I think/ In my opinion/ Lily&#39;s opinion</p><p>I don&#39;t think Lily&#39;s opinion is a good one.
