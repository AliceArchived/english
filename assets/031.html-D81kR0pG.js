However, once she starts facing real-life responsibilities, I believe she’ll understand how useful that knowledge can be.</p><p>Lily 不喜欢这门合同课，说实话我能理解。我觉得主要原因是她还缺乏现实世界的经验。她年纪还轻，而且一直沉浸在自己的绘画和音乐世界中。正因为她专注于创作领域，可能更难理解学习合同的重要性，毕竟合同常被视为枯燥或太技术化的内容。不过，一旦她开始面对现实生活中的责任，我相信她就会明白这些知识有多实用。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><p>Natural fluency and tone suitable for IELTS Speaking</p><p>Variety of expressions: &quot;deeply immersed,&quot; &quot;dry or overly technical&quot;</p><p>Balanced opinion with both empathy and logic</p><p>Clear organization: reason → explanation → future reflection</p><hr><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?</strong></p><p>I believe Lily dislikes the contracts class mainly because she lacks practical life experience, which makes the subject feel distant and hard to relate to.

She appears to be a young student who is more focused on creative pursuits like painting and music. As a result, she might not yet see the relevance of contracts in her daily life. Additionally, a lack of exposure to real-life challenges could make the course feel unrelatable or even tedious. However, contracts are a fundamental part of adult life — from signing a rental agreement to starting a job. In time, she may realize that this class equips her with skills that are essential for independence.</p><p>Lily 似乎不喜欢这门合同课，我可以理解她的想法。她看起来是一个年轻的学生，更专注于绘画和音乐等创作领域。因此，她可能还没有意识到合同在日常生活中的重要性。此外，缺乏现实生活经验也会让这门课显得难以理解，甚至有些枯燥。然而，合同在成年生活中无处不在——从签租房合同到开始工作。随着时间的推移，她可能会意识到这门课程实际上是在为她的独立生活提供必要的技能。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><p>Strong coherence: Each sentence builds on the previous one logically.</p><p>Balanced tone: Shows empathy toward Lily but also highlights real-life importance.</p><p>Wide lexical resource: Uses formal phrases like “creative pursuits,” “lack of exposure,” “equips her with skills.”</p><p>Grammatical accuracy: Includes conditionals and compound-complex sentences, aligning with Band 7+ requirements.</p><hr><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?</strong></p><p>Lily seems to dislike the contracts class, and I believe this may be due to a lack of real-world experience. Without encountering situations where contracts play a major role — such as signing leases or employment agreements — it’s understandable that the subject may feel abstract or unnecessary to her. Furthermore, she might not have engaged actively in group activities, which can make a course less enjoyable and harder to follow. In everyday life, however, understanding contracts is extremely important. Whether we are renting, buying, or working, we are constantly dealing with legal agreements, so this course offers valuable skills for the future.</p><p>Lily 似乎不喜欢这门合同课，我认为这可能是因为她缺乏现实生活经验。如果没有经历过需要合同的重要场合，比如签租房合同或就业协议，就很容易觉得这门课抽象甚至没有必要。此外，她可能在小组活动中没有积极参与，这也会让课程变得枯燥难以跟进。然而，在日常生活中，理解合同极为重要。无论是租房、买东西，还是工作，我们都经常处理各种法律协议，因此这门课为未来提供了宝贵的技能。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><p>This writing sample fits IELTS Band 7+ standards:</p><ul><li>Task achievement: Directly addresses the question with clear, supported arguments.</li><li>Coherence and cohesion: Smooth transitions between ideas (e.g., &quot;Furthermore&quot;, &quot;However&quot;).</li><li>Lexical resource: Includes topic-relevant vocabulary like “abstract,” “legal agreements,” and “valuable skills.”</li><li>Grammatical accuracy: Demonstrates a wide range of sentence structures and precise language.</li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: Lily dislikes it/ I think she/ Maybe it&#39;s because</p><p>Lily dislikes the <s>constract</s> class, which I can totally understand.
