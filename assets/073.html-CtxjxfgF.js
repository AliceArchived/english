Tell us.</span></a></h4><p>In this story, a man bought a suit, but it wasn&#39;t the color he had expected. He wanted to return it, but Lily, the store employee, told him that refunds were only possible if the item was damaged. So, <strong>in a rather bold move</strong>, the man tore the sleeve of the suit on purpose in order to qualify for a refund. It&#39;s a <strong>humorous</strong> example of someone <strong>bending the rules</strong> to get what they want.</p><p>在这个故事中，一位男士买了一套西装，但颜色不是他想要的。他想退货，但店员莉莉告诉他只有在商品损坏的情况下才可以退款。于是，这名男子大胆地撕破了西装的袖子，好让自己符合退款条件。这是一个幽默的例子，展示了人们如何“钻空子”以达成自己的目的。</p><h4 id="in-your-opinion-who-s-right-lily-or-the-manager-why" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-your-opinion-who-s-right-lily-or-the-manager-why"><span>In your opinion, who&#39;s right, Lily or the manager? Why?</span></a></h4><p>In my opinion, both Lily and the manager have <strong>valid points</strong>. Lily followed the store&#39;s policy and didn&#39;t do anything wrong — she simply acted <strong>within her responsibilities</strong> as <strong>a regular employee</strong>. At the same time, I think the manager was also right to <strong>step in</strong>. Handling difficult customers often requires flexibility, and as someone with more authority, the manager has the ability to make exceptions when necessary. So while Lily <strong>upheld</strong> the rules, the manager showed good judgment in resolving the situation.</p><p>在我看来，Lily 和经理都有道理。Lily 遵守了商店的规定，没有做错任何事——她只是作为普通员工履行了自己的职责。同时，我认为经理介入也是对的。应对难缠顾客时往往需要一定的灵活性，而经理拥有更高的权限，可以在必要时做出例外处理。所以，Lily 坚守了规则，而经理则展现了良好的判断力来解决问题。</p><ul><li>uphold: 英 /ʌpˈhəʊld/, 美 /ʌpˈhoʊld/ <ul><li>vt. 赞成；支撑；鼓励；举起</li><li>We have a duty to uphold the law. <ul><li>维护法律是我们的责任。</li></ul></li><li>to uphold a conviction / an appeal / a complaint <ul><li>维持原判；受理上诉/申诉</li></ul></li><li>an <strong>upholder</strong> of traditional values <ul><li>支持传统价值观的人</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><h4 id="what-happened-in-this-story-tell-us-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened-in-this-story-tell-us-1"><span>What happened in this story?
