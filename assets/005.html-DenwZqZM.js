Even if it bothers Eddy a little, at least he&#39;s not trying to sleep. It&#39;s much better than waking up to drums at 5 a.m.! During the day, Eddy can always move to another room if he really needs quiet.</p><p>我觉得 Junior 白天练鼓是可以的。就算有点打扰 Eddy，起码他不是在睡觉。总比早上五点被鼓声吵醒强吧！白天的话，如果 Eddy 真需要安静，他也可以换个房间。</p><p>I think Junior should practice the drums in the afternoon. That way, he won’t wake up Eddy early in the morning or disturb him while he’s working. It’s a good time for both of them.</p><p>我认为 Junior 应该在下午练鼓。这样他既不会一大早吵醒 Eddy，也不会在 Eddy 工作时打扰他。这个时间对他们俩都合适。</p>',24)]))}const u=o(r,[["render",a]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/I/005.html","title":"I Need to Practice","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"I Need to Practice It's late at night.
