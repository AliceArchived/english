Instead of focusing on <strong>soccer training</strong>, he had the kids play <strong>musical instruments</strong> and <strong>march around</strong>. While creativity is important, his methods had nothing to do with improving their soccer skills. A coach should help players build teamwork and technique, but Oscar seemed more interested in <strong>putting on a show</strong> than <strong>preparing the team</strong>. So yes, I believe he deserved to be fired.</p><p>说实话，我觉得奥斯卡并不是一个合格的教练。他没有专注于足球训练，反而让孩子们玩乐器、做队列表演。虽然创意也很重要，但他的方法完全没有帮助孩子们提升足球技巧。一个教练应该帮助队员提高配合能力和技术水平，但奥斯卡似乎更在意表演而不是比赛准备。所以我认为他被解雇是合理的。</p><hr><p>The choice between “effective coach” and “qualified coach” depends on what you&#39;re trying to emphasize.
