You&#39;ve been invited to Oscar&#39;s Winter Gathering on December 29th. It&#39;s the city&#39;s most <strong>exclusive</strong> event to discuss the best and worst in arts and culture this year.</p><p>This invitation means that Oscar considers you intelligent enough to share your opinions with him!</p><p>Guests must keep in mind the following rules:</p><h3 id="_1-no-uninformed-opinions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-no-uninformed-opinions"><span>1. No <strong>Uninformed</strong> Opinions</span></a></h3><p>Guests must confirm that they have read and watched everything on Oscar&#39;s annual list of 100 books and films.</p><p>Please note, Oscar may ignore this rule for people who can prove that they&#39;re as knowledgeable as he is… or have won a <strong>Nobel</strong> Prize.</p><h3 id="_2-no-red-wine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-no-red-wine"><span>2. No Red Wine</span></a></h3><p>Last year, Oscar kindly forgave Vikram for spilling a drop of red wine on his valuable white rug. This was only after Vikram apologized repeatedly and replaced the ruined rug with a more expensive one. As a result, guests may only enjoy clear liquids.</p><h3 id="_3-no-children" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-no-children"><span>3. No Children</span></a></h3><p>Although Oscar loves teaching children, this gathering is his opportunity to teach adults. And frankly, adults need more instruction about arts and culture than children.</p><p>Those who break the rules will not be invited back next year. Oscar looks forward to seeing you!</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Would you go to Oscar&#39;s Winter Gathering? Why or why not?</strong></p><p>I wouldn’t go to Oscar’s Winter Gathering. <strong>From the invitation</strong>, I <strong>get the impression</strong> that he’s <strong>quite full of himself</strong>. I <strong>mean</strong>, how many people can really win a Nobel Prize? Does he even have that <strong>level</strong> of knowledge? And why should Vikram <strong>be expected to</strong> make up for his mistake by buying a more expensive rug? That just doesn’t seem fair at all.</p><p>我不会去 Oscar 的冬季聚会。从邀请来看，我觉得他挺自大的。我是说，有多少人能真正拿到诺贝尔奖呢？他真的有那样的学识吗？而且为什么 Vikram 要被要求用更贵的地毯来弥补他的错误？这听起来一点都不公平。</p><hr><ul><li>“Should Vikram <strong>be expected</strong> to make up for his mistake…” <ul><li>This phrasing talks about what is expected or reasonable in general — it reflects on what’s fair, not what actually happened.</li><li>It’s more about questioning whether the expectation itself (even if already imposed or acted on) was fair or justified.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Would you go to Oscar&#39;s Winter Gathering?

Does himself knowledgable enough? And why Vikram should made up his mistake by replace a more expensive rug? It&#39;s unreasonable!</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“Does himself knowledgable enough?” → incorrect word order and form; should be “Is he knowledgeable enough himself?”</li><li>“should made up” → wrong tense; should be “should have to make up”</li><li>“by replace” → needs to be “by replacing”</li><li>“a person full of ego” → smoother as “full of ego” (or “so full of himself”)</li><li>Minor style tweaks for naturalness (e.g., “win a Nobel Prize” sounds more idiomatic than “get a Nobel Prize”)</li></ol><p>I would not go to Oscar’s Winter Gathering.
