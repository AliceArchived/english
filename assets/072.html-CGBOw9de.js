It&#39;s getting started this week.</p><p>Everyone seems excited to join. The club will read different books and talk about them. The next steps include picking a book and meeting every Friday.</p><p>I hate it. The idea of a reading club is not <strong>thrilling</strong>. As far as I&#39;m concerned, I do not need to talk to people about books. I read alone in my room, surrounded by silence. That&#39;s my idea of a good time.</p><p>In the reading club, I&#39;ll have to make eye contact and smile. I&#39;ll need to pay attention to other people&#39;s opinions. I have my own opinions about books, and I don&#39;t need to share them. There might be discussions about characters and themes. I get the feeling we&#39;ll spend lots of time talking, and less time reading.</p><p>Zari told me she&#39;s excited to join. She&#39;s likely to ask me to come along. I suppose I&#39;ll have to listen to her talk about all the books she&#39;s read. She&#39;ll probably make me talk too. But I have no clue how to say no when she insists.</p><p>So, let&#39;s cancel this reading club idea before it gets started. Even if I had to attend, I wouldn&#39;t enjoy turning books into group activities. Reading deserves to be a solo journey. I hope everyone figures out that reading alone is the best way to enjoy a book.</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><h2 id="chinese" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chinese"><span>Chinese</span></a></h2><p>阅读俱乐部</p><p>Lily 的校报专栏</p><p>我们学校成立了一个新的阅读俱乐部。本周开始运作。</p><p>大家似乎都很兴奋地想加入。俱乐部会阅读不同的书，并讨论它们。接下来的步骤包括选一本书，并在每周五见面。</p><p>我讨厌这个主意。阅读俱乐部的想法一点也不让人激动。就我而言，我不需要和别人讨论书。我喜欢一个人在房间里阅读，被安静包围。这才是我理想的美好时光。</p><p>在阅读俱乐部里，我得与人眼神交流，还得微笑。我必须注意听别人的意见。我对书有自己的看法，但我不需要分享它们。可能会有关于人物和主题的讨论。我觉得我们会花很多时间说话，而读书的时间会更少。</p><p>Zari 跟我说她很期待加入。她很可能会邀请我一起去。我想我得听她滔滔不绝地讲她读过的所有书。她大概还会逼我也说几句。但她一旦坚持，我根本不知道该怎么拒绝。</p><p>所以，在这个阅读俱乐部开始之前，我们就该取消它。即便我必须参加，我也不会喜欢把读书变成集体活动。阅读应该是一段独自的旅程。我希望大家都能明白，独自阅读才是享受一本书的最佳方式。</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><h2 id="speaking-writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking-writing"><span>Speaking &amp; Writing</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?</strong></p><p>I don’t think we should cancel the reading club just because Lily feels stressed. I completely understand her situation, but in my view, it’s important to remember that the club is <strong>voluntary</strong>. People can decide whether they want to join based on their <strong>comfort level</strong>. If someone enjoys reading in a group, they’re welcome to participate, but if they find it <strong>overwhelming</strong>, they’re free to leave. This way, the club can still benefit those who genuinely enjoy it without forcing anyone to stay.</p><p>我不认为应该因为 Lily 感到压力就取消读书会。我完全理解她的处境，但在我看来，必须记住这个活动是自愿的。人们可以根据自己的舒适程度决定是否加入。如果有人喜欢在小组中读书，他们可以参加；如果觉得有压力，也可以选择退出。这样，读书会既能为真正喜欢它的人提供价值，也不会强迫任何人留下。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Balanced tone: Shows empathy for Lily but also considers the group’s benefit.</li><li>Clear structure: States opinion → acknowledges Lily → explains choice → provides conclusion.</li><li>Lexical range: Uses “voluntary,” “comfort level,” “overwhelming,” “genuinely enjoy.”</li><li>Spoken fluency: Natural linking phrases and conversational flow.</li></ol><hr><ul><li>voluntary: 英 /&#39;vɒləntri/, 美 /&#39;vɑːlənteri/ <ul><li>adj. 自愿的, 志愿的 <ul><li>义务的, 无偿的</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="🌟-writing-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-writing-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Writing Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?</strong></p><p>I believe the reading club should not be cancelled solely because one member feels stressed. While I <strong>sympathize</strong> with Lily and understand that group activities can sometimes be overwhelming, the club provides value to many other participants who genuinely enjoy reading and discussing books together. Participation should remain <strong>voluntary</strong>, allowing individuals to join or leave based on their personal preferences. This <strong>flexible approach</strong> ensures that the club remains inclusive without forcing anyone to engage in an activity that makes them uncomfortable. Ultimately, the aim of such a club is to <strong>foster</strong> a love of reading, not to create pressure.</p><p>我认为不应仅仅因为某位成员感到压力就取消读书会。虽然我对 Lily 表示同情，也理解集体活动有时会让人感到负担，但读书会为许多真正喜欢读书并乐于讨论的人带来了价值。参加应保持自愿原则，让人们根据个人喜好选择加入或退出。这种灵活的方式可以确保读书会保持包容性，同时不会强迫任何人参与让他们不舒服的活动。归根结底，这类活动的目的在于培养阅读的热爱，而不是制造压力。</p><blockquote><p>Explanation:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Task achievement: Fully addresses the question with balanced reasoning.</li><li>Coherence: Smooth logical flow from empathy → group value → voluntary nature → conclusion.</li><li>Lexical sophistication: Uses academic expressions like “solely because,” “participants,” “inclusive,” “foster a love of reading.”</li><li>Grammatical accuracy: Contains varied sentence structures and no errors.</li></ol><hr><ul><li>inclusive: 英 /ɪn&#39;kluːsɪv/, 美 /ɪn&#39;kluːsɪv/ <ul><li>adj. 包括…的, 包括一切的 <ul><li>包括所述的限度</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I think/ Lily feels/ In my opinion</p><p>I don&#39;t think we should <strong>cancel</strong> the reading club.
