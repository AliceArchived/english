He seems to <strong>lack patience and understanding</strong> with others, which makes me think he wouldn’t be a good teacher. Also, the program <strong>focuses only on</strong> his own paintings, which means we’d be <strong>discussing</strong> art that isn’t well-known or influential in <strong>the art world</strong>.</p><p>我不想去参加 Oscar 的艺术项目。他看起来对别人缺乏耐心和理解，我觉得他不会是一个好老师。而且这个项目只关注他自己的画作，也就是说我们讨论的艺术并不出名，也没有什么影响力。</p><blockquote><p>Polished according to story:</p></blockquote><p>No, I wouldn’t want to go to Oscar’s art program. He seems more <strong>focused on himself</strong> than on the students. When he announced that the winner would <strong>get to spend</strong> hours <strong>hearing</strong> him talk about his own paintings, it didn’t sound like a fun or inspiring experience. I’d prefer a program <strong>where students get to learn, explore, and share their own ideas</strong>.</p><p>不，我不想去 Oscar 的艺术项目。他看起来更关注自己，而不是学生。当他说获胜者将花上好几个小时听他讲自己的画作时，这听起来一点都不有趣也不激励人。我更喜欢那种让学生学习、探索并分享自己创意的课程。</p><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>Wow, this is hard to watch. <ul><li>Lily struggles to be friendly with people.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>thrilling: 令人激动的</li><li>podium: 演讲台</li></ul>',24)]))}const h=o(r,[["render",a]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/T/009.html","title":"The Art Competition - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"The Art Competition - B2 Lily is participating in her school's art competition.
