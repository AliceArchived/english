However, I do see <strong>a practical issue</strong>. As the float moves forward and finishes the painting, what happens next? Should it start painting again? If so, different parts of the audience would see different stages — some enjoying <strong>the live creation process</strong>, while others only see <strong>the finished result</strong>. This inconsistency might weaken the overall impact and make the experience less enjoyable for some viewers.</p><p>我认为奥斯卡提出的“由花车在游行过程中绘画”的想法非常有创意，肯定能给人留下深刻印象。但我也注意到一个现实问题：当花车完成画作后，接下来要怎么处理？是否应该重新开始画一幅？如果是这样，不同位置的观众就会看到不同的画面——有些人能看到现场创作的过程，而另一些人只能看到已经完成的作品。这种观赏上的不一致可能会削弱整体效果，让一部分观众的体验不够理想。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What would make Oscar&#39;s parade unforgettable?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I think/ The idea of/ Oscar&#39;s advice about</p><p>I think the idea of Oscar&#39;s advice about a floating brushing painting a picture during a parade would make the parade <strong>unforgettable</strong>, though it could difficult to <strong>do</strong>.
