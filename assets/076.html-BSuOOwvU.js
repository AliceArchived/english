Do you have an enemy? How did that person become your enemy?</strong></p><p>Yes, I do have a few people I <strong>would consider</strong> enemies. In real life, <strong>simply being kind</strong> doesn&#39;t always <strong>lead to</strong> friendship. In fact, some people take advantage of your <strong>kindness</strong> and see it as a <strong>weakness</strong>. I&#39;ve learned that with those kinds of people, you have to <strong>set</strong> clear <strong>boundaries</strong> and <strong>stand your ground</strong>. We should be kind, but only to those who treat us with respect. It&#39;s important to protect yourself while still being a good person.</p><p>是的，我确实有几个我认为是“敌人”的人。在现实生活中，光是待人友好并不一定能换来友谊。事实上，有些人会利用你的善良，把它当作软弱的表现。我逐渐明白，对于这种人必须划清界限、坚定立场。我们当然应该善良，但只对那些尊重我们的人。做个好人没错，但保护自己同样重要。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why did Kai throw wine at Oscar?</strong></p><p>Kai threw/ insulted her/ got upset</p><p>Kai threw wine at Oscar because she thought Oscar&#39;s words insulted her and got her upset.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>“she thought Oscar&#39;s words insulted her” → 更自然表达为 “she felt insulted by his words”</li><li>“and got her upset” → 改为更地道表达 “they really upset her”</li></ol><p>Kai threw wine at Oscar because she <strong>felt insulted by</strong> his words — they really upset her.</p><p>Kai 把酒泼向 Oscar，因为她觉得他的话侮辱了她，让她很生气。</p><hr><p><strong>Oscar has a new enemy!
