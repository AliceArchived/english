Well, I&#39;m writing to tell you that I feel it&#39;s unfair for me to continue doing my <strong>chores</strong> until you pay me back.</p><p>Therefore, until your loan has been repaid to me in full, the following chores will be reassigned to you:</p><p><strong>Washing Dishes</strong></p><p>You&#39;ll be responsible for washing the dishes every day. And you may not put them away while they are still wet.</p><p>As you always <strong>say</strong>, &quot;Washing the dishes includes drying the dishes.&quot; I think this rule is <strong>dumb</strong>, but it&#39;s your rule, so you must follow it.</p><p>Also, don&#39;t cheat and buy paper plates. It&#39;s bad for the environment.</p><p><strong>Picking Up My Toys</strong></p><p>Please put all of my toys into the big blue box in my closet. You have my permission to play with my action figures, but don&#39;t put Skull Man in the closet. He is afraid of the dark.</p><p>And because I&#39;m feeling generous, you may play my video games before putting them away. Just don&#39;t change my settings!</p><p><strong>Cleaning the Bathroom</strong></p><p>I propose that we eliminate this chore. Why do we have to clean the bathroom at all? Doesn&#39;t the toilet clean itself every time you flush?</p><p>Let&#39;s just stop doing it. We&#39;ll both be happier.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t paid me back by next week, expect more of my chores to be added to this list.</p><p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Junior</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p>Why can&#39;t Skull Man go in the closet?</p><p>Skull Man can&#39;t / because / afraid of</p><p>Skull Man can&#39;t be put in the closet because he is afraid of the dark.</p><blockquote><p>Corrections:</p></blockquote><ol><li>&quot;can&#39;t be put in the closet&quot; → passive voice is acceptable but “can’t go in the closet” is more natural and closer to the original story tone.</li></ol><p>Skull Man <strong>can’t go in</strong> the closet because he is afraid of the dark.</p><p>Skull Man 不能进衣柜，因为他害怕黑暗。</p>',27)]))}const c=t(i,[["render",n]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/duolingo/story/E/007.html","title":"Eddy's Chores - B2","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Duolingo"],"tag":["English","Duolingo","story"],"description":"Eddy's Chores - B2 Dear Dad, Do you remember that time you borrowed $25 for pizza?
