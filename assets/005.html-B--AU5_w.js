Poor Paul doesn’t even get a chance — it’s like the bird is his worst wingman.</strong><br> 我最喜欢的是 Zari 希望 Paul 说点甜蜜的话，结果那只鹦鹉一直插话，根本停不下来！可怜的 Paul 连开口的机会都没有，简直像带了个最糟糕的“翅膀队友”。</p><p><strong>My favorite part is when Zari is all ready for a sweet moment with Paul, but the parrot totally steals the show—squawking nonsense and ruining everything.
