When people <strong>haven’t yet</strong> dealt with contracts in real life — like renting an apartment or signing up for services — it&#39;s hard to see why they matter. Maybe she also had trouble working with others, which made the class more frustrating. In my opinion, learning about contracts is essential, because in real life, avoiding them is nearly impossible.</p><p>我认为 Lily 不喜欢合同课，主要是因为她没有足够的现实生活经验，无法理解它的重要性。当一个人还没有经历过真实的合同，比如租房或注册服务时，很难意识到合同的意义。也许她在课堂上与他人合作不顺利，这让她更反感这门课。在我看来，了解合同是非常必要的，因为在现实生活中，几乎无法避免接触合同。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: Lily dislikes it/ I think she/ Maybe it&#39;s because</p><p>Lily dislikes the contract class which I think she just doesn&#39;t have enough practical life experiences.
