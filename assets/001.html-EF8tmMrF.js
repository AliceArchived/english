Why?</strong></p><p>I think the most useful item among the three is the pack of pens. To be honest, none of the options are extremely useful for me, but <strong>if I had to make a choice</strong>, I’d definitely <strong>go with the pens</strong>. The paper towels seem a bit risky because they’re old and might carry germs, especially in times like these when hygiene is important. As for the watch, I already rely on my phone to check the time. So <strong>practically speaking</strong>, the pens are the safest and most useful option.</p><p>我认为这三样物品中最有用的是那一包笔。说实话，这些选项对我来说都不是特别实用，但如果非要选一个，我肯定会选笔。旧纸巾看起来有些不卫生，可能携带细菌，尤其是在现在这个非常注重卫生的时期。至于手表，我平时已经习惯用手机看时间了。所以从实际角度来说，笔是最安全也最实用的选择。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which item seems most useful to you?
