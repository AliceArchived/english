Don&#39;t worry! You can still be a pirate. No ship needed! Here&#39;s my advice:</p><p><strong>Make a Pirate Flag</strong></p><p>Every pirate needs a flag. But you don&#39;t need a ship to have one! You can put a pirate flag in your room or your backyard. Our flag is easy to make. Draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of cloth. Now you have a pirate flag!</p><p>Conquer Your Space</p><p>Pirates conquer places all the time. You can conquer your space too. This means you should make your room look like a pirate&#39;s place. Put up maps, swords, and maybe even a toy parrot. Now you have conquered your room!</p><p>Talk Like a Pirate</p><p>Pirates have their own way of talking. You can start using pirate words, like &quot;Arrr!&quot; and &quot;Matey!&quot; When you meet friends, say, &quot;Ahoy!&quot; It makes everything more fun. Now that the internet exists, you can even find pirate words online.</p><p>Being a pirate is all about adventure and fun. You don&#39;t need a ship to enjoy the pirate life. With a flag, your space, and pirate talk, you&#39;re ready to go.</p><p>Remember: Don&#39;t work too much!</p><p>Lin</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><ul><li>skull: 英 /skʌl/, 美 /skʌl/ <ul><li>n. 头盖骨，脑壳</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="style" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#style"><span>Style</span></a></h2><ul><li>&quot;Have you ever wanted to be a pirate, but you don&#39;t have a ship?&quot; <ul><li>Style suggestion: &quot;Have you ever wanted to be a pirate but don’t have a ship?&quot;</li><li>The comma before “but” is optional; omitting it keeps tone more fluid and casual.</li></ul></li><li>&quot;No ship needed!&quot; <ul><li>Style suggestion: &quot;No ship required!&quot;</li><li>“Required” sounds smoother, though “needed” is acceptable for tone — optional change.</li></ul></li><li>&quot;Put up maps, swords, and maybe even a toy parrot.&quot; <ul><li>Style suggestion: &quot;<strong>Hang up maps</strong>, <strong>display swords</strong>, maybe even <strong>add a toy parrot</strong>.&quot;</li><li>More vivid verbs to enhance imagery; original is fine, but this is more pirate-themed in tone.</li></ul></li><li>&quot;Now that the internet exists, you can even find pirate words online.&quot; <ul><li>Style suggestion: &quot;<strong>With the internet</strong>, you can even find pirate words online.&quot;</li><li>Smoother flow; “now that the internet exists” sounds overly formal for the casual blog voice.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>在一块布上画一个骷髅和交叉骨头的图案。 <ul><li>Draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of cloth.</li><li>cloth: fabric</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>What part of Lin&#39;s pirate advice is best?</strong></p><p>Personally, I really like Lin’s <strong>pirate advice</strong>. The best part, in my opinion, is the idea that you don’t actually need a ship to live like a pirate. I find that especially interesting because it means anyone can embrace the pirate lifestyle just by focusing on the theme and attitude. It’s more about <strong>the spirit of adventure and creativity</strong> than owning a real ship. That makes it feel fun and easy to try, even for people like me who live far from the sea.</p><p>就我个人而言，我非常喜欢 Lin 的海盗建议。在我看来，最棒的部分是你其实不需要一艘船就可以过上海盗般的生活。我觉得这特别有趣，因为它意味着任何人只要专注于主题和态度，都可以体验这种风格。这更像是一种冒险和创意的精神，而不是必须拥有一艘真正的船。这让人觉得有趣又容易尝试，甚至像我这样住在内陆的人也能参与其中。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What part of Lin&#39;s pirate advice is best?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I like/ My favorite part/ Lin&#39;s pirate advice</p><p>I like Lin&#39;s idea.
