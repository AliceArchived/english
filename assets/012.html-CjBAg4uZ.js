She regularly demonstrates this in my kitchen with weeks-old leftovers when she&#39;s too lazy to cook.</p><p>On top of all this, she&#39;s surprisingly athletic. In the past, she&#39;s been able to run faster than the local gym teacher, Eddy, to get the last hot dog at a barbecue.</p><p>As you can see, there&#39;s no job candidate quite like Lin.
