I was cleaning up my apartment (well, my grandma Lucy&#39;s apartment), and I found some interesting things. They might sound surprising, but they could be useful to you. This is what I have today:</p><p><strong>Smelling Salts - Free</strong></p><p>I found these smelling salts in a drawer. They might belong to my grandmother or maybe a long-lost hero. Who knows? They&#39;re not expired, so they&#39;re good to go. If you feel faint or need a wake-up call, these are perfect for you. They&#39;re free!</p><p><strong>Glass Bottle - 3 dollars</strong></p><p>This glass bottle once held some mysterious drink. Now it&#39;s empty, clean, and waiting for its next role. Fill it with water, sand from the beach, or even some homemade sauce. It&#39;s like a blank canvas for glass!</p><p><strong>Empty Cup - 1 dollar</strong></p><p>I have an empty cup that didn&#39;t make it to the recycling bin. It&#39;s perfectly fine, really. Use it for your morning coffee or a cup of noodles. It&#39;s sturdy and ready to be filled with whatever your heart desires.</p><p>That&#39;s all I have for today!</p><p>Call, text, or email me!</p><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which item seems most useful?
