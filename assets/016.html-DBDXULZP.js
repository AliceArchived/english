Be descriptive.</strong></p><p>From my <strong>perspective</strong>, Eddy <strong>sees</strong> Oscar <strong>as</strong> a friend and tries to connect with him by chatting and gossiping. However, Oscar doesn’t share the same feelings. He finds Eddy’s behavior — especially his habit of gossiping — annoying. In fact, Oscar is so uncomfortable that he deliberately injures his foot just to escape the conversation and leave the closet. This shows that their relationship is one-sided and somewhat <strong>strained</strong>.</p><p>在我看来，Eddy 把 Oscar 当作朋友，并试图通过聊天和八卦与他建立联系。然而，Oscar 并不这么认为。他觉得 Eddy 的行为，尤其是爱八卦这一点，让人烦躁。实际上，Oscar 感到如此不自在，以至于故意弄伤了自己的脚，只为了摆脱这段对话并离开储藏间。这表明他们的关系是单方面的，甚至有些紧张。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>How would you describe Eddy and Oscar&#39;s relationship?
