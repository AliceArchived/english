Why?</strong></p><p>My favorite part of the story was when Bea told the tourists not to smile because smiling would make them look like tourists — even though they clearly were tourists. I found this moment especially humorous because Bea&#39;s overly artistic instructions, like directing them to look thoughtfully at the sky or capturing their reflection in a puddle, completely ignored the tourists&#39; simple request for a typical photo with the fountain. This ironic <strong>contrast</strong> between Bea’s <strong>exaggerated</strong> seriousness and the tourists&#39; genuine confusion made the scene both amusing and memorable for me.</p><p>我最喜欢故事里 Bea 告诉游客不要笑的那一段，她说笑会让他们看起来像游客，而实际上他们就是游客。我觉得这个场景尤其好笑，因为 Bea 给出的那些过于艺术化的指导，例如让游客凝视天空，假装在沉思，或者特意去拍地上水坑里的倒影，完全忽视了游客只是想拍一张普通喷泉照的请求。这种 Bea 夸张的认真态度与游客真切困惑之间的反差，使得这一幕既幽默又令人印象深刻。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>What was your favorite part of the story?
