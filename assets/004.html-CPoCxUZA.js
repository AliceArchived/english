Today, the question is, &#39;How can I get my children to clean up?&#39; It&#39;s not easy, but I have some ideas. I&#39;m a dad, and I have tried many things to get my son, Junior, to clean up. Here&#39;s what you can do:</p><p><strong>Make Cleaning A Game</strong></p><p>Turn cleaning up into a game. Your children won&#39;t mind, will they? You can set a timer and say, &quot;Let&#39;s see who can clean up the fastest!&quot; The winner gets a hug or maybe some candy. Junior loves this, and <strong>sometimes</strong> he even cleans up everything!</p><p><strong>Use A Surprise Box</strong></p><p>Create a surprise box! Put toys or snacks inside and tell your children that if they clean up their things, they get to see what&#39;s inside the box. It&#39;s almost like a treasure hunt. Junior gets really excited about this, it&#39;s fun for both of us!</p><p><strong>Lead By Example</strong></p><p>Show them how it&#39;s done. Clean up with them and make it fun! Put on some music and dance while you clean up. I like to do this in my red sweatsuit. It&#39;s not high fashion, but it&#39;s fun, isn&#39;t it? Your children will start to enjoy cleaning together.</p><p>With these tips, cleaning up can be easy and fun!</p><p>Stay strong!</p><p>Eddy</p><h2 id="vocabulary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary"><span>Vocabulary</span></a></h2><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><h2 id="speaking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speaking"><span>Speaking</span></a></h2><h3 id="🌟-speaking-band-7-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#🌟-speaking-band-7-0"><span>🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which of Eddy&#39;s tips do you like best?</strong></p><p>I think Eddy is a really clever and creative father. <strong>Among</strong> all his tips, my favorite one is how he turns cleaning into a treasure hunt. It’s such a smart way to make kids feel excited about doing chores. Instead of seeing cleaning as something boring, they now think of it as a game. Eddy&#39;s idea doesn’t just make the house tidier — it also helps children build responsibility while having fun. I would definitely try this method myself one day.</p><p>我认为 Eddy 是一个非常聪明且有创意的父亲。在他所有的建议中，我最喜欢的是他把打扫变成了寻宝游戏。这是一个非常巧妙的方法，让孩子们对做家务感到兴奋。他们不再觉得打扫无聊，而是把它当作游戏来看待。Eddy 的想法不仅让家里更整洁，还能让孩子在快乐中培养责任感。我将来一定也会尝试这种方法。</p><h3 id="practice-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-history"><span>Practice History</span></a></h3><p><strong>Which of Eddy&#39;s tips do you like best?</strong></p><p>Helpful Phrases: I think /My favorite tip / Eddy&#39;s idea about</p><p>I think Eddy is a very smart dad.
