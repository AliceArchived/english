She dressed herself slowly.<br> 她精心选择着她将来的颜色，慢慢腾腾地妆饰着。<br> She adjusted her petals one by one.<br> 一片片地搭配着她的花瓣。<br> She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.<br> 她不愿象野罂粟那样一出世就满脸皱纹。<br> It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear.<br> 她要让自己带着光艳夺目的丽姿来到世间。</p><p>Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature!<br> 是的，她是非常爱俏的生命。<br> And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.<br> 她那不可思议的美丽打扮要持续好些好些日子。<br> Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.<br> 然后，在一天的早晨，恰好在太阳升起的时候，她开放了。<br> And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:<br> 她已经精细地做了那么长的准备工作，却打着哈欠说道：<br> &quot;Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged...<br> “啊！我刚刚睡醒，真对不起，瞧我的头发还是乱蓬蓬的 ⋯”</p><p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration: &quot; Oh! How beautiful you are! &quot;<br> 小王子这时再也抑制不住自己的爱慕心情：“你是多么美丽啊！<br> &quot;Am I not?&quot; the flower responded, sweetly. &quot; And I was born at the same moment as the sun...<br> 花儿悠然自得地说：“是吧？我是与太阳同时出生的…⋯.<br> The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest-- but how moving-- and exciting-- she was!<br> 小王子可以很容易看出来这花儿不太谦虚，可是她确实丽姿动人。<br> &quot;I think it is time for breakfast,&quot; she added an instant later. &quot; If you would have the kindness to think of my needs.&quot;<br> 她随后又说道：“现在该是吃早点的时候了吧，请你也想着给我准备一点…”</p><p>And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.<br> 小王子很有些不好意思，于是就拿着喷壶，打来了一壶清清的凉水，浇灌着花儿。<br> So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity-- which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with.<br> 于是，就这样，这朵花儿就以她那有点难以应付的虚荣心折磨着小王子。<br> One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: &quot; Let the tigers come with their claws! &quot;<br> 例如，有一天，她向小王子讲起她身上长的四根刺：“让老虎张着爪子来吧！”<br> &quot;There are no tigers on my planet, &quot; the little prince objected. &quot; And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.&quot;<br> 小王子顶了她一句：“在我这个星球上没有老虎，而且，老虎是不会吃草的”。</p><p>&quot;I am not a weed, &quot; the flower replied, sweetly.<br> 花儿轻声说道：“我不是草。”<br> &quot; Please excuse me...&quot;<br> “请原谅我……<br> &quot;I am not at all afraid of tigers, &quot; she went on, &quot; but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn&#39;t have a screen for me?&quot;<br> “我一点都不怕什么老虎，可我讨厌穿堂风。我想你没有屏风给我吧？”<br> &quot;A horror of drafts-- that is bad luck, for a plant, &quot; remarked the little prince, and added to himself, &quot; This flower is a very complex creature..:<br> 小王子思付着：“讨厌穿堂风 ⋯⋯.这对一株植物来说，真不走运，这朵花儿真是个复杂的生物.....&quot;</p><p>&quot;At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live<br> “晚上我要你把我放在玻璃罩下面保护好。你住的这地方太冷。<br> In the place I came from--&quot; But she interrupted herself at that point.<br> 我原来住的那个地方.….””但她没有说下去。<br> She had come in the form of a seed.<br> 她来的时候是粒种子。<br> She could not have known anything of any other worlds.<br> 她哪里见过什么别的世界。<br> Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naive untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.<br> 她叫人发现她是在凑一个如此不太高明的谎话，她有点羞怒，咳嗽了两三声，她的这一招是要让小王子处于有过失的地位。</p><p>&quot; The screen?&quot;<br> “屏风呢？”<br> &quot;I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me...<br> “我刚刚正准备去拿，可你正好跟我说到……<br> Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.<br> 于是花儿强迫自己多咳嗽了几声，依然要使小王子后悔自己的过失。<br> So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her.<br> 尽管小王子本来诚心诚意地喜欢这朵花，可是，这一来，却使他很快对她产生了怀疑。</p><p>He had taken seriously words, which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.<br> 小王子对一些无关紧要的话看得太认真，这使他自己很不开心。<br> &quot;I ought not to have listened to her, &quot; he confided to me one day.<br> 有一天他告诉我说：“我本不该听信她的话。<br> &quot;One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance.<br> 一个人绝不该听信那些花儿的话，只需要简单地看看它们，闻闻它们的芬芳就可以了。<br> Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.<br> 我的那朵花使我的星球芳香四溢，可我不会享受它的恩惠。</p><p>This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.&quot;<br> 关于老虎爪子的事，本应该使我产生柔情和同情的，却反而使我恼火……<br> And he continued his confidences: &quot; The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything!<br> 他继续袒露心扉：“事实上是我不知道怎么去理解事物！<br> • I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words.<br> 我应该根据她的行为，而不是根据她的话来判断她。<br> She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me.<br> 她用自己的芬芳和光辉包围了我。</p><p>I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems.<br> 我真不该离开她跑出来，我本应该猜出在她那令人爱怜的花招后面所隐藏的温情。<br> Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her...&quot;<br> 花是多么自相矛盾！我当时太年轻，还不懂得爱她。”</p>',13)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",h]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/reading/prince/007.html","title":"Chapter 07","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"noto:page-facing-up","date":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Writing"],"tag":["小王子"],"toc":true,"description":"Chapter 07 I soon learned to know this flower better. 很快我就进一步了解了这朵花儿。 On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. - 在小王子的星球上，花儿一直是很简单的。 They had only ...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Chapter 07\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/AliceArchived\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://alicearchived.github.io/english/reading/prince/007.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"English Study Record"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Chapter 07"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Chapter 07 I soon learned to know this flower better. 很快我就进一步了解了这朵花儿。 On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. - 在小王子的星球上，花儿一直是很简单的。 They had only ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"小王子"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-08-04T03:10:32.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1754277032000,"updatedTime":1754277032000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice","username":"Alice","email":"alys8715ia@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alice"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":6.54,"words":1961},"filePathRelative":"reading/prince/007.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>I soon learned to know this flower better.<br>\\n很快我就进一步了解了这朵花儿。<br>\\nOn the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. -<br>\\n在小王子的星球上，花儿一直是很简单的。<br>\\nThey had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody.<br>\\n它们只有一圈花瓣；它们一点也不占地方；它们不是任何人的麻烦。<br>\\nOne morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away.<br>\\n早晨它们在草丛中开放，晚上它们就静静地凋谢了。<br>\\nBut one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up.<br>\\n但是有一天，不知从哪里来了一颗种子，一种新的花到来了。</p>","autoDesc":true}`);export{d as comp,p as data};
