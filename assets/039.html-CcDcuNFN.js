In my view, the main purpose of a vacation is to <strong>take a break</strong> from daily responsibilities, <strong>reduce stress</strong>, and <strong>recharge</strong> both <strong>physically and mentally</strong>. While some people enjoy a full schedule of sightseeing and events, I believe such vacations can be exhausting. I have heard of people returning from trips feeling even more tired than before. For me, an ideal vacation involves rest, peace, and enough time to truly recover — so I can return to work feeling refreshed and productive.</p><p>就我个人而言，我更喜欢轻松的假期，而不是安排满满的活动。在我看来，假期的主要目的是暂时摆脱日常责任、减压并让身心恢复。虽然有些人喜欢排得满满的行程和活动，但我认为那样反而让人疲惫。我听说过有人度假回来比之前还累。对我来说，理想的假期是有休息、有宁静、有真正恢复时间的假期——这样回到工作岗位时才能神清气爽，更有效率。</p><p>🌟 亮点表达：</p><table><thead><tr><th>表达</th><th>用法说明</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>rather than one filled with...</strong></td><td>高分对比结构，表达清晰偏好</td></tr><tr><td><strong>take a break from daily responsibilities</strong></td><td>表达“从日常事务中抽离”更正式</td></tr><tr><td><strong>recharge both physically and mentally</strong></td><td>地道表达“身心恢复”</td></tr><tr><td><strong>return to work feeling refreshed and productive</strong></td><td>表达度假目的的高阶词组</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentences"><span>Sentences</span></a></h2><ul><li>你说这家酒店为客人提供免费的活动！你现在想去浮潜还是潜水？ <ul><li>You said this hotel has <strong>complimentary</strong> activities for guests!
