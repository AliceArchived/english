## Question

### According to the rules of reported speech, which sentence correctly reports this question? “When is your birthday?”

- a He asked me when my birthday is.
- b He asked me when my birthday was.
- c He asked me when was your birthday.

---

- **Grammatically**, both **a** and **b** can be correct.
- For grammar tests or exams, **b** "He asked me when my birthday was" is usually expected — because it follows the standard rule of backshifting.
- In real-life English, **a** "**He asked me when my birthday is**" is also acceptable — especially because birthdays **don’t change**, and the fact is **still true now**.

### Which sentence best uses narrative tenses to tell this story in the past?

- a I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I was seeing storm clouds coming.
- b I relaxed on the beach when suddenly I’d seen storm clouds coming.
- c I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I saw storm clouds coming.

---

- c I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I saw storm clouds coming.

Here's why:
This sentence correctly uses narrative tenses, which are typically:

- Past continuous – to describe the background action
- Past simple – to describe the sudden or interrupting event

In sentence **c**:

- "I was relaxing" = past continuous (background action)
- "I saw" = past simple (interrupting/sudden event)

This is the most natural and grammatically correct use of narrative tenses.

- a I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I was seeing storm clouds coming.
  - ✗ Incorrect: "was seeing" is not normally used — “see” is **a stative verb** and doesn’t usually appear in continuous form.
- b I relaxed on the beach when suddenly I’d seen storm clouds coming.
  - ✗ Incorrect tense use: "I had seen" (past perfect) suggests you saw the clouds before you relaxed, which doesn’t match the logical order of events.

Also, "I relaxed" (simple past) isn't the best choice for describing an ongoing background action — we prefer past continuous.

### In which sentence does the connecting word make sense?

- a We arrived late at the cinema because we missed the beginning of the film.
- b Because we arrived late at the cinema, we missed the beginning of the film.
- c We arrived late at the cinema but we missed the beginning of the film.

---

- b Because we arrived late at the cinema, we missed the beginning of the film.

Explanation:

- This sentence makes logical cause-and-effect sense:
  - “Because we arrived late...” (the reason)
  - “we missed the beginning...” (the result)

This is a correct and natural use of the connecting word "because" at the beginning of the sentence.

### Which sentence uses a preposition of place correctly?

- a I saw Helen on the supermarket today.
- b I saw Helen in the supermarket today.
- c I saw Helen with the supermarket today.

---

- b I saw Helen in the supermarket today.

Explanation:

- "**in the supermarket**" is the correct preposition of place — it tells us that Helen was inside the supermarket when you saw her.

### “In 2017, I started studying Spanish. In 2019, I visited Spain for the first time.” Which sentence correctly describes these events?

- a I have been studying Spanish for two years before I first visited Spain.
- b Before I first visited Spain, I have been studying Spanish for two years.
- c I had been studying Spanish for two years before I first visited Spain.

---

- c I had been studying Spanish for two years before I first visited Spain.

Explanation:

- This sentence correctly uses the past perfect continuous tense ("had been studying") to show that:
  - The action of studying Spanish started before visiting Spain,
  - And it continued for two years up to that point.

This is exactly how we describe **a longer past action that happened before another past event.**

---

- a I have been studying Spanish for two years before I first visited Spain.
  - ✗ Incorrect tense: "have been studying" is **present perfect continuous**, which doesn’t match the past time marker “before I first visited Spain”.
- b Before I first visited Spain, I have been studying Spanish for two years.
  - ✗ Same issue as a: "have been studying" doesn’t fit with a past time frame. You need past perfect when referring to two actions both completed in the past.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |

### Which sentence is correct?

- a Lionel Messi is a world famous football player.
- b Lionel Messi is a world-famous football player.
- c Lionel Messi is a world-famous football-player.

---

- b Lionel Messi is a world-famous football player.

Explanation:

- "world-famous" is a compound adjective — it should be hyphenated because it describes "football player" as a single idea.
- "football player" is not hyphenated — it’s a common noun phrase (noun + noun), and does not require a hyphen.

| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| a _world famous_                 | ✗ No hyphen        | ❌       | Compound adjective needs a hyphen |
| b _world-famous football player_ | ✅ Correct         | ✅       | Proper use of compound adjective  |
| c _football-player_              | ✗ Incorrect hyphen | ❌       | Noun phrase doesn’t need a hyphen |

### Which sentence uses the present continuous correctly?

- a “I think you’re telling me lies. I’m not believing you!”
- b “I’m not checking my email. I’m studying!”
- c “Please explain that to me again. I’m not understanding you.”

---

- b “I’m not checking my email. I’m studying!”

Explanation:

- This sentence correctly uses the **present continuous** to describe actions happening right now:
  - ✅ "I’m not checking my email" — current action being **deliberately avoided**
  - ✅ "I’m studying!" — current action being actively done

---

- a “I think you’re telling me lies. I’m not believing you!”
  - ✗ "**believe**" is **a stative verb** (non-action verb), which usually isn’t used in continuous form.
  - ✔ Correct version: "I don’t believe you!"
- c “Please explain that to me again. I’m not understanding you.”
  - ✗ "understand" is also a stative verb, and is normally used in simple present.
  - ✔ Correct version: "I don’t understand you."

| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| a _I’m not believing_     | ✗ Stative verb | ❌       | Use simple present: "I don’t believe"    |
| b _I’m studying_          | ✅ Action verb | ✅       | Proper use of present continuous         |
| c _I’m not understanding_ | ✗ Stative verb | ❌       | Use simple present: "I don’t understand" |

### Which sentence uses the articles ‘a/an/the’ correctly?

- a I saw a fox last night. The fox was looking in the rubbish for food.
- b You’re a best dad ever!
- c The sugar is bad for your teeth.

---

- a I saw a fox last night. The fox was looking in the rubbish for food.

Explanation:

- **“a fox”** — this is the **first time** the fox is mentioned, so we use "**a**" (indefinite article).
- **“the fox”** — now the fox is **already known**, so we use "**the**" (definite article).
- ✅ This is the proper way to introduce something and then refer back to it.

---

- b You’re a best dad ever!
  - ✗ Incorrect article: it should be “You’re the best dad ever!”
  - Use "the" with superlatives (e.g., the best, the biggest, the most beautiful).
- c The sugar is bad for your teeth.
  - ✗ Not wrong in all contexts, but more natural in general statements to say:
    - ✔ “Sugar is bad for your teeth.”
  - Use no article when speaking about things in general (uncountable nouns like "sugar").

---

| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| a _a fox / the fox_ | ✅ Correct      | ✅ Introduce + refer back                                       |       |
| b _a best dad_      | ✗ Wrong article | ❌ Use **“the”** with superlatives                              |       |
| c _The sugar_       | ✗ Too specific  | ❌ Omit article when speaking generally about uncountable nouns |       |

### Jim’s car is broken. Choose the correct adjective to complete this sentence: Jim’s old car is…

- a …knackered.
- b …tired.
- c …exhausted.

---

- a …knackered.

Explanation:

- "**Knackered**" is British informal/slang and means **broken**, **worn out**, or **not working properly** — perfect for describing **a car** that's no longer functioning well.
  - ✔ "Jim’s old car is knackered." = It’s broken or falling apart.

---

- b tired
  - ✗ "Tired" is used for people or animals, not machines or cars.
  - ❌ "Jim’s old car is tired." → sounds odd or poetic, but not standard.
- c exhausted
  - ✗ Same as "tired" — typically used for living beings, not machines.
  - ❌ "Jim’s old car is exhausted." → not natural English.

---

### Which verb can fill ALL the gaps to make THREE correct sentences? 1. Let’s **\_\_** away these old clothes to charity. 2. I’m trying to **\_\_** up smoking. It’s such a bad habit! 3. You have to **\_\_** way to oncoming traffic at this junction.

- a make
- b give
- c take

---

- b give

---

1. Let’s give away these old clothes to charity.
   - ✔️ "Give away" means to donate or give something for free — correct!
2. I’m trying to give up smoking. It’s such a bad habit!
   - ✔️ "Give up" means to stop doing something (often a habit) — correct!
3. You have to give way to oncoming traffic at this junction.
   - ✔️ "Give way" means to yield or let other vehicles go first — correct!

---

- a make
  - ✗ Make away, make up, make way → Not all of them fit correctly or naturally in these sentences.
- c take
  - ✗ Take away is okay for sentence 1.
  - ✗ Take up is the opposite of "give up" — incorrect for sentence 2.
  - ✗ Take way is not a correct phrase in sentence 3.

---

| Sentence | Correct phrase | Verb  |
| -------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1        | give away      | **b** |
| 2        | give up        | **b** |
| 3        | give way       | **b** |

### Which sentence best uses narrative tenses to tell this story in the past?

- a I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I was seeing storm clouds coming.
- b I relaxed on the beach when suddenly I’d seen storm clouds coming.
- c I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I saw storm clouds coming.

---

- c I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I saw storm clouds coming.

Explanation of Narrative Tenses:

- Narrative tenses are used to tell stories about the past, and they often combine:
  - Past continuous – for background or ongoing actions
    - ➤ "I was relaxing..."
  - Past simple – for completed or sudden actions that interrupt
    - ➤ "I saw storm clouds coming."

---

- a "I was relaxing on the beach when suddenly I was seeing storm clouds coming."
  - ✗ "was seeing" is not natural — "see" is a stative verb, and it's not normally used in the continuous form.
  - Correct form: "I saw storm clouds..."
- b "I relaxed on the beach when suddenly I’d seen storm clouds coming."
  - ✗ Awkward and illogical use of past perfect ("I had seen") — this tense is used for an action that happened before another past action, but here the storm clouds come after or during relaxing.
  - Also, "I relaxed" sounds like a completed action, not an ongoing situation — past continuous would be better.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| a _was seeing_         | ✗ Incorrect stative verb usage   | ❌       | "See" isn’t used in continuous here |
| b _had seen_           | ✗ Illogical sequencing           | ❌       | Doesn’t match the story timeline    |
| c _was relaxing / saw_ | ✅ Past continuous + past simple | ✅       | Best narrative tense use            |

### Which sentence uses the present perfect tense correctly?

- a I have been to Japan last year.
- b I have lost my car keys!
- c We have got married in 2016.

---

- b I have lost my car keys!

Explanation:

- This sentence correctly uses the present perfect tense:
  - "have lost" = present perfect of the verb "lose"
  - It expresses a recent event with a present result — you’ve lost your keys, and they’re still missing now.

---

- a I have been to Japan last year.
  - ✗ Incorrect use of time expression: “last year” refers to a finished time in the past, so use past simple.
  - ✔ Correct version: I went to Japan last year.
- c We have got married in 2016.
  - ✗ Same issue: “in 2016” is a specific past time, so it should be past simple.
  - ✔ Correct version: We got married in 2016.

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |

| b _have lost_                    | ✅ No specific time              | ✅              | Present result (still lost) |       |
| c _have got married_ + “in 2016” | ✗ Present perfect with past time | ❌              | Use past simple             |       |
