# Zari’s Driving Lesson

Zari, a teenager, is driving a car for the first time.

Bea is in the passenger’s seat, giving her a driving lesson.

- **Zari**: Am I driving well?
- **Bea**: Please, look at the road!
  - Also, slow down. It’s dangerous to drive fast.
- **Zari**: Sorry!
- **Bea**: Turn left here.

**Zari makes a turn.**

- **Bea**: That was a right turn.
- **Zari**: Sorry.

Suddenly, another car almost hits them.

- **Bea**: Be careful!
- **Zari**: That guy is a terrible driver! He almost hit us!
- **Bea**: This is a one-way street, Zari.
- **Zari**: Someone should tell him that.
- **Bea**: Actually, you’re going the wrong way.
- **Zari**: Oh no! Should I stop?
- **Bea**: No, **drive** faster!
- **Zari**: You just said that’s dangerous!
- **Bea**: Yes, but it’s also dangerous if they catch us.
- **Zari**: What? Who’s going to catch us?
- **Bea**: You hit two parked motorcycles back there.
  - Now a lot of people on motorcycles are following us!

Zari looks **in** **the rearview mirror**.

- **Zari**: They are following us!

**Zari drives faster.**

- **Bea**: Zari!
- **Zari**: What?!
- **Bea**: You’re driving very well!
- **Zari**: Really?
- **Bea**: Yes! You drive much better when you’re afraid!
