# Zari vs. Lily - B2

Zari stands in front of the rest of the debate team after school, excited to begin a competition.

- **Teacher**: Today Zari is going to debate against ... Lily!

Lily **sighs** as she **walks to** the front of the classroom.

- **Zari**: Lily? What are you doing here?
- **Lily**: This is my punishment for arguing with Mr. Yamamoto in class.
- **Zari**: Sorry, Lily, but I'm going to beat you. I never lose debates!
- **Lily**: Whatever. I don't care.
- **Teacher**: Today's topic is whether or not every student should learn to play an instrument. Zari will argue that students should learn to play instruments, and Lily will argue against her.

Lily sits up, interested.

- **Zari**: I'll start! I think we could all agree that every student should play a musical instrument because studies show that music is good for your brain.
- **Lily**: I disagree. Most students who play instruments have no talent, and we shouldn't have to listen to terrible music.
- **Zari**: You said you didn't care about debating!
- **Lily**: I care about music.

Ten minutes later, Lily and Zari are still debating.

- **Zari**: It's obvious that students should play instruments because music ... makes everyone happy!

Lily turns to the audience.

- **Lily**: How many of you have been unhappy when you were forced to listen to student musical performances?

Students cheer.

- **Zari**: But everyone loves the school **orchestra**!

Zari takes a violin out of her backpack and prepares to play.

A few students groan and cover their ears.

- **Lily**: Zari just proved my point.

Five minutes later, the teacher adds up the scores.

- **Teacher**: After a surprisingly close debate ... Lily wins! She'll get to participate in every debate for the rest of the year!
- **Zari**: I'm disappointed I lost ... but I'm excited you're joining the debate team!
- **Lily**: This is what I get for being **passionate**.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Do you agree with Lily or with Zari? Why?**

#### Support Lily

I agree with Lily, but for a slightly different reason. I think that if students aren’t naturally talented in music, they shouldn’t be required to study it. Forcing them to do so could lead to frustration and poor results. It’s also unfair to others who have to sit through off-key performances. In my view, it’s more beneficial for students to focus their efforts on areas where they show real potential.

我同意 Lily 的观点，但理由稍有不同。我认为如果学生在音乐方面没有天赋，就不应该强迫他们学习音乐。强迫他们这样做可能会导致挫败感和糟糕的表现，也对其他不得不听走调表演的人不公平。在我看来，学生更应该把精力投入到自己真正擅长的领域。

#### Support Zari

I agree with Zari because I believe that learning music has value beyond just talent. Music education can improve concentration, creativity, and emotional expression. Even if a student **isn't naturally gifted**, the experience of learning an instrument can still be meaningful and enjoyable. Not everything we learn has to lead to **mastery** — sometimes, the process itself is **worthwhile**.

我支持 Zari 的观点，因为我认为学习音乐的价值不仅仅在于天赋。音乐教育可以提升专注力、创造力以及情感表达能力。即使一个学生没有天赋，学习乐器的过程也依然可以是有意义且令人享受的。我们学习的东西不一定都要成为专家，有时候，学习的过程本身就很有价值。

- mastery: 英 /ˈmɑːstəri/, 美 /ˈmæstəri/
  - n. 精通；优势；统治权；征服；掌握

### Practice History

**Do you agree with Lily or with Zari? Why?**

> Corrections:

1. **"students who have no talent in music learning music"** → phrasing is awkward and unclear. It should be:
   → **"students who have no talent for music learning it"** or better:
   → **"students who have no talent for music learning it is not only bad..."**
2. **"is not only bad for other people but for themselves"** → missing **"also"** in parallel structure:
   → **"is not only bad for other people but also for themselves."**

🌟 I agree with Lily, but for **a slightly different reason**. I think students who **have no talent for music** should not be forced to learn it. **Doing so** is not only bad for others—who have to listen to poor performances—but also for the students themselves. They would be **better off investing** their time and money **into** something they are genuinely good at.

我同意莉莉的观点，但理由略有不同。我认为那些没有音乐天赋的学生不应该被强迫学习音乐。这不仅对其他人不好（因为他们得忍受糟糕的表演），对学生自己也是一种浪费。他们应该把时间和金钱投入到真正擅长的事情上。

- **“better off”** = 处境更好、更有利
- **“investing into...”** = 把……投入到……

> Corrections:

1. "have no talent for music" — clear, but could be more natural as “aren’t musically **inclined**” for IELTS Band 7+.
2. “Doing so is not only bad for others…” — this clause is grammatically correct, but could be more formal: “It can **negatively affect** both others and the students themselves.”
3. “investing… into” — the verb “invest” is **more natural with “in”** than “into” when used in this context.

I agree with Lily, but for a slightly different reason. I believe that students who aren’t **musically inclined** shouldn’t be forced to learn music. It can negatively affect both those who have to listen to **subpar** performances and the students themselves. They would be **better off** investing their time and money in something they are truly good at.

- subpar: 英 /'sʌb'pɑː/, 美 /ˌsʌb'pɑr/
  - adj. 低于标准的；在平均水平以下的；次佳的

I agree with Lily. Not all students have **a** talent **for** music, and if they don't have talent, they should study something else that they are interested **in**.

- have a talent for/ have talent in
  - have a talent for (something) → This is the standard and most natural phrase in English.
    - She has a talent for music.
    - He has a talent for languages.
    - They have a real talent for drawing.
  - have talent in (something): Less common / awkward
    - have talent in (something)
    - → This is grammatically possible, but it's less idiomatic and sounds a bit awkward in everyday speech. It's occasionally used in academic or formal contexts.
      - She has talent in mathematics. ✅ (acceptable but not preferred)
      - ✘ She has talent in music. → better: "She has a talent for music."

---

> - “but **from a** different angle” is understandable, but more natural phrasing is “but I see it from a different angle” or “but from a different perspective.”
> - “put their time **in** other places” → should be “put their time **into** other things/areas.”
> - “learn something they **are** really good at and really **like**” → better phrased as “learn something they’re truly good at and passionate about” for fluency and variety.

I agree with Lily, but **from a different perspective**. Actually, if students don't like music, they should **put** their time **into** other areas and learn something they’re **truly good at** and **passionate about**.

---

> - “**but** not on the audience side” → unclear. More natural would be: “but not from the audience’s perspective.”
> - “why **should** they waste their time **learning** it?” → grammatically fine, but sounds slightly informal.
> - “something they **are** really **interested** in” → grammatically okay, but smoother as “something they’re truly interested in” or “something they genuinely enjoy.”

I agree with Lily, **but** not **from** the audience’s **perspective**. I think for the students themselves, if they are not talented in music and not interested in **it**, why **should they** waste their time **learning** it? They should spend **their time** on something they’re **truly interested in**.
