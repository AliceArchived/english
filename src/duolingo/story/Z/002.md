# Zari's Crisis

Zari and Lily are looking through the window of a **pet grooming business**.

- **Lily**: Look at the cute dogs. Don't you think they're adorable?
- **Zari**: No, I'm so sad that not even dogs can cheer me up.
- **Lily**: Zari, you can't be this sad about a K-pop band breaking up. Bands break up all the time.
- **Zari**: But without them, **the world feels like a bottomless black pit**. My life has no meaning.
- **Lily**: You're starting to sound like me. I don't like it.
  - Let's go. I have another idea.

Lily takes Zari to her favorite ice cream store and buys two chocolate ice cream **cones** with extra **sprinkles**.

- **Lily**: Why aren't you eating this **sickeningly** sweet ice cream? It's your favorite flavour.
- **Zari**: I have no appetite. Nothing will taste good to me ever again.
- **Lily**: You're refusing to eat ice cream? OK, now I'm worried.

Lily suddenly gets an idea.

- **Lily:** Come on, let's go somewhere else.

Lily leads Zari to her favorite **clothing store**.

Nearly everything in the store is pink.

- **Zari**: OK, I really hope this cheers you up because I hate this store.
  - All of this pink hurts my eyes.
- **Lily:** I don't want to try anything on. I just want to **mourn**.

Zari scrolls through the band's social media account on her phone and sighs.

- **Lily:** What if I try something on?

Lily puts on a **hideous** pink sweater.

- **Lily**: Look, Zari, I'm wearing pink for the first time in my life. What do you think?

Zari looks up from her phone and sees Lily. She laughs.

- **Lily:** Wait, did you just laugh?
- **Zari**: Yeah. I just realized you're doing all this to make me feel better.
- **Lily:** Obviously. You're my best friend.
- **Zari**: You used the word "cute", ate **sprinkles**, and even wore pink for me!
- **Lily:** I'm glad you're feeling better. Now never mention this again.

## Writing

I think that what Lily did was good. There is not the best way to make a friend feel better**;** it depends on who you are and what kind of things your friends like. But using your heart and **trying** to do things they really like is a good choice.

I think that what Lily did was good. There isn‚Äôt **a single best way** to make a friend feel better**;** it depends on who you are and what kinds of things your friends like. But using your heart and **trying** to do things they really **enjoy** is a good choice.

1. Really like
   - Very common and natural
   - Slightly more **casual**
   - Fine to use in most conversations or informal writing
2. Really enjoy
   - Sounds a bit more **polished/formal**
   - Fits well in reflective or thoughtful writing (like your paragraph)
   - Adds variety when "like" has already appeared earlier in the sentence:

> "...what kinds of things your friends **like**. But using your heart and trying to do things they really **enjoy**..."
