# Updated Bakery Policies - Corrected

After several recent issues with customers, my husband Vikram and I are **instituting** the following rules for our bakery. If you're asking yourself, "Do I have to follow them?" the answer is "yes".

First of all, our bakery is not a free workspace. You can't just buy one **donut** in the morning and use our free Wi-Fi until closing, Bea. (“doughnut” is also correct but more traditional. “Donut” is common in informal or U.S. bakery settings.)

Secondly, no one is allowed in the kitchen except for Vikram and Lin.

Junior, you cannot come into the kitchen to taste the fresh cookies "for quality control."

Thirdly, our oven is only for food.

Oscar, you can't use it for your **pottery** anymore.

I'd honestly rather not have our cupcakes taste like **clay**!

Finally, no, Eddy, Vikram is not opening the bakery two hours early anymore just so you can have a **croissant** before you run at 6 a.m.

If you have any questions, don't ask Vikram! He is too nice to say no, but I will happily deny any of your requests.

## Writing

**Do you think the new policies are reasonable? Why or why not?**

I think these new rules are reasonable. The kitchen should only allow staff in, so it is easy to ensure food quality and safety. The store is a business, so just buy a small thing and use the facility all day is not good and also affects other customers to use them.

> 1. **“so it is easy”** → 更自然为 **“so it is easier”**（表达“更容易”确保质量）
> 2. **“just buy a small thing and use the facility all day”** → 句式不清晰，应改为 **“buying just one small item and then using the facilities all day”**（名词化结构更通顺）
> 3. **“is not good and also affects other customers to use them”** → 不符合英语表达习惯，应为：
>    → **“is not appropriate, and it also affects other customers’ ability to use them”**
>    1. **“affect someone’s ability to do something”** 是**语法正确**、**逻辑严密**，而且在英语中**非常常用**的表达结构。

I think these new rules are reasonable. The **kitchen** should be **restricted to** staff only, so it is **easier** to ensure food quality and safety. The store is a business, so buying just **one small item** and then using the **facilities** all day is not **appropriate** — it also prevents other customers from using them.\*\*.

我认为这些新规定是合理的。厨房应该只允许员工进入，这样更容易保证食品的质量与安全。商店毕竟是做生意的，只买一件小东西却整天使用店内设施是不合适的，而且也会影响其他顾客使用。

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| The noise affected my **ability to concentrate**.                            | 噪音影响了我**集中注意力的能力**。         |
| Lack of sleep affects your **ability to make decisions**.                    | 睡眠不足会影响你**做决定的能力**。         |
| The slow internet affected students’ **ability to finish the test on time**. | 网络太慢影响了学生**按时完成考试的能力**。 |

**职场英语 / 报告写作**："The new policy may affect employees’ **ability** to complete tasks efficiently."

**学术论文**："Anxiety can negatively impact a student’s **ability** to retain information."

**日常表达**："Heavy traffic affects my **ability** to get to work on time."

在原句中的使用是完全标准的：

> **It also affects other customers’ ability to use the facilities.**
> = 影响了其他顾客使用这些设施的能力/机会。

在这里，“ability” 并不等同于生理能力，而是指“可使用的权利、条件或可达性（accessibility）”。它符合英文表达**含蓄、逻辑准确**的风格。

如果换成中文类比理解：

- 中文可能说：“影响了其他顾客使用这些设施的**机会**”
- 英文中不会说 “affect others to use”，而是说：
  → “affect others’ **ability to use**”

**“It also affects other customers’ ability to use them.”**

这里的 **“ability”** 并不强调身体能力，而是表示**“可使用的机会、权利或条件”**。这在英文中非常常见，用于表达因为某些人占用资源，导致**他人失去使用这些资源的机会**。

什么不用 “affects other customers to use them”?

因为 **“affect + someone + to do something”** 是不符合英语语法结构的。

举个例子：

- ❌ _The noise affected me to sleep._ → 不对
- ✅ _The noise affected my ability to sleep._ → 正确 ✔️

这是因为 **“affect”** 后面不能直接加动词不定式（to do），而应该加一个**名词结构**，如：

- **affect health**
- **affect performance**
- **affect ability to concentrate**
- **affect the ability to access public resources**

### 所以这句话为什么用 “ability” 是正确的：

- **They buy one small item and use the facilities all day.**
  → **This affects other customers’ ability to use them.**

✔ 这里的“ability”表示的是：
**其他顾客原本可以使用这些设施的机会或权利被影响了。**

I think ~~it is~~ reasonable policies. Since **the** bakery needs **to be** safe, Junior, **as he is not** a worker, should not **be** allowed to go into the kitchen. And **since** it **is** a business, it should consider **its** profit, not just making friends.

- **"it is reasonable policies"** – mismatch between singular “it is” and plural “policies.” Should be **"they are reasonable policies"** or **"it is a reasonable policy"** depending on the intended number.
- **"Junior, as he is not a worker..."** – grammatically correct but can be more concise and natural.
- **"it should consider its profit, not just making friends."** – grammatically okay but “making friends” is informal; "building relationships" may be a better fit depending on tone.

I think **they are reasonable policies**. Since the bakery needs to be safe, and **because Junior is not a worker**, he should not be allowed into the kitchen. And since it is a business, it should consider its profit, not just **making friends**.

- **"These are"** is more direct and natural than "they are" when referring back to “policies.”
- Replaced “and because...” with a smoother “and since...”
- Swapped “be allowed into” for the simpler “be allowed in.”
- Changed “making friends” to **“building friendships”**, which sounds more professional or intentional in a business context.

I think **these are** reasonable policies. The bakery needs to be safe, and since Junior isn’t a worker, he shouldn’t be allowed in the kitchen. As a business, it should also focus on making a profit—not just **building friendships**.

I think the new policies are reasonable and they should **have implemented them** earlier. **The kitchen** should only allow staff to **enter** to **ensure** the food is safe. **The** bakery is a business, **not a place** for people to stay for free.

- **"they should have implemented them earlier"** – correct in meaning, but a clearer version is **“should have been implemented earlier.”**
- **"The kitchen should only allow staff to enter to ensure the food is safe."** – grammatically correct but could be smoother.
- **"The bakery is a business, not a place for people to stay for free."** – fine, but "hang out" or "loiter" might sound more natural depending on the tone.

I think the new policies are reasonable and **should have been implemented earlier**. Only staff should be allowed in the kitchen to ensure food **safety**. The bakery is a business, **not a place for people to hang out for free**.
