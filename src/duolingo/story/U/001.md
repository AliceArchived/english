# Uncle Edward's House

Eddy and Junior walk into a big, dark house full of dusty, old furniture.

- **Eddy**: Come on, Junior! I can't wait to show you this house.
- **Junior**: This house is scary!
- **Eddy**: No, it's not. I came here a lot when I was little.
  - Anyway, it's our house now! When Uncle Edward died, he left it to us.
  - Although I always thought he hated me...
- **Junior**: Dad, are we moving here?
- **Eddy**: Of course! It's much bigger than our apartment.
- **Junior**: But I love our apartment. This house looks dirty.
- **Eddy**: It's just dark. Turn on the lights.

Junior tries to turn on a light. Sparks come out of the wall.

- **Eddy**: We'll fix that.

They walk into a dining room with an enormous **chandelier**. Eddy touches it.

- **Eddy**: I've always wanted a chandelier...
- **Junior**: Dad, look out!

The chandelier falls and almost hits Eddy.

- **Eddy**: Whoops. Wow, it's not broken!
  - Hey, look at that amazing wallpaper.

Junior looks closely at a wall covered in dark spots.

- **Junior**: That's **mold**.

They go into a bedroom upstairs. There's a hole in the roof. Birds are flying in and out.

- **Junior**: We can't sleep here!
- **Eddy**: You've always wanted a pet bird, right?

Eddy and Junior walk into a bathroom.

- **Eddy**: This is my favorite thing in the house.

Eddy jumps into the bathtub.

The floor breaks. Eddy and the bathtub fall down **into** the room below.

Junior shouts down to Eddy.

- **Junior**: Dad! Are you OK?
- **Eddy**: I'm fine!
- **Junior**: Dad, this house is really dangerous!
- **Eddy**: Yeah. Now I know why Uncle Edward left it to me.

Eddy and Junior drive home with the chandelier in their car.

- **Eddy**: Well, at least we got a new chandelier.
