# Karaoke Controversy - B2

"Local Teacher Goes from Protester to Karaoke Regular"

By Dana Chen, The Town **Herald**

---

Koko's Karaoke Bar's recent move to a new neighborhood was a little **controversial**.

On opening day, there was one very loud protester, and since then, things have changed dramatically. That single protester is now the karaoke bar's most frequent customer: local artist and teacher Oscar.

Initially, Oscar was upset to learn that his neighborhood was welcoming a karaoke bar — a business he considered **unsophisticated**.

However, when a single audience member cheered loudly after Oscar's first performance of a song from his favorite opera, he promised to perform "at least three nights each week"!

However, not everyone is a fan.

Many customers now feel Koko's environment is too serious and competitive compared to other karaoke bars. Local resident Lin explained that most people go to karaoke for fun, whereas:

- **Lin**: Oscar sings five very long opera songs **in a row** and criticizes everyone else's performance.

On the other hand, if you like listening to one man sing opera all night, you'll truly enjoy going to Koko's.

One regular named Eddy claimed he was very grateful to Oscar, saying:

- **Eddy**: Who else would introduce me to things I never would have heard of, like opera or eating raw fish?

When Oscar was asked to comment on his mixed reviews, he declined, saying that he needs to rest his voice before his next performance.

## Writing

### Would you go to Koko's Karaoke when Oscar is singing? Why or why not?

I probably will not go to Koko's Karaoke when Oscar is singing. It is so annoying when someone sings so many songs in a row alone. Everyone should have a chance.

> Corrections:

1. **“I probably will not go…”** → This is grammatically okay, but more natural as **“I probably wouldn’t go…”** (conditional, polite, common in spoken English).
2. **“when someone sings so many songs in a row alone”** → a bit awkward. Better as: **“when one person sings too many songs in a row by themselves.”**

### Polished

> 🌟 natural and IELTS Band 7–8 level

I probably wouldn’t go to Koko’s Karaoke when Oscar is singing. It’s really annoying when one person sings too many songs in a row by themselves. I think **everyone** should **get a fair chance** to **participate**.

Oscar 唱歌的时候，我可能不会去 Koko 的卡拉 OK。一个人连着唱很多首歌真的很烦人。我觉得每个人都应该有机会参与。

I probably **will** not go **to** the Koko's Karaoke when Oscar is singing. He is so annoying, **As** a self-respect person, one should not sing ~~songs~~ too **many songs** in a row. They should share opportunities **with** others. But surely, Oscar doesn't think this way.

> Corrections:

1. **“I probably will not go to the Koko's Karaoke…”**
   - “the Koko’s Karaoke” 中的 **“the”** 不需要（专有名词前通常不加 the）
   - 改为：**“I probably won’t go to Koko’s Karaoke…”**
2. **“As a self-respect person”**
   - 用词不自然，应为：**“As someone with self-respect”** 或更直接：**“Out of self-respect”**
3. **“share opportunities with others”**
   - 语法对，但可以更自然地说成：**“let others have a turn”**

I probably **would not** go to Koko’s Karaoke when Oscar is singing. He is so annoying. **Out of self-respect**, **I believe** no one should sing too many songs in a row. **People** should let others **have a turn**—but **clearly**, Oscar does not think **that** way.

我大概不会在 Oscar 唱歌的时候去 Koko 的卡拉 OK。他真的很烦。出于自尊，我认为任何人都不该一首接一首地唱太多歌。大家应该轮流，但显然 Oscar 并不这么想。
