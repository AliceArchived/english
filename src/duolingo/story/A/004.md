# A Grown-up Birthday - B2

Dear Friends and Family,

You are invited to my eighth birthday party on Saturday. In case you would like to give me a gift, here are my new, sophisticated interests that are way better than the kids' stuff I used to like.

Everyone knows candy is for children, which is why, as an older kid, I prefer fancy, dark chocolate.

Apparently, it's good for you because it contains less sugar than milk chocolate, which is exactly the kind of thing grown-ups care about.

That means I can eat as much as I want!

Although I love my pet frog, Sugar, a more mature animal would be a better pet for someone as wise and experienced as me.

So if you're wondering what to get me, a huge, fifty-year-old tortoise would be a great choice instead of another frog, which is a pet for babies.

When I was a kid, I loved to play video games because they were fun.

But now, I play video games to learn important skills that I will need as a grown-up, like how to fight zombies and dance in space.

So I'd like some new, more expensive video games to help me prepare for being an adult.

Lastly, like all adults, I also love cash. In fact, that's what I'd prefer!

Sincerely,

Junior

### Writing

#### Do you think Junior understands what it means to be an adult? Why?

In my opinion, Junior **becomes** an older kid, but still a kid. He is asking for **gifts**, but as an adult, it means responsibility. As an adult, if one **asks for** something, they also need to provide something in exchange. Junior surely doesn't understand that.

1. Since you’re judging Junior based on what he wrote and he already _claims_ to be an “older kid,” your sentence should reflect that you're evaluating his **self-perception**, not describing a process of growing.
2. “but still a kid” is a sentence fragment; it should be combined properly.
3. Repetition of “As an adult” sounds awkward; consider varying the structure.
4. “If one asks for something, they also need to provide something in exchange” is acceptable, but “should be ready to give something in return” sounds smoother.

In my opinion, Junior **may call himself** an older kid, but **he’s** still **just** a kid. He is asking for **gifts**, but **being an adult** means responsibility. **When** an adult asks for something, they should also be ready to **give** something **in return**. Junior surely doesn't understand that.
