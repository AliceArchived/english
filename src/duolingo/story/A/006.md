# A Love Story

Lin is looking at pictures of her grandfather with Lucy.

- **Lin**: How did Grandpa ask you to marry him?
- Lucy: Well, I remember we were driving through the city. He said he had a surprise.
  - He stopped the car. He told me that he needed to get something.
- **Lin**: The ring?
- **Lucy**: No, he got a suitcase and **ran back** to the car.
- **Lin**: He was probably excited!
- **Lucy**: He jumped in the car, and we drove to the mountains.
- **Lin**: That's romantic!
- **Lucy**: We were driving really fast. Then, another car started to follow us.
- **Lin**: Oh no!
- **Lucy**: We **drove off** the road. Your grandpa told me to take his suitcase and run.
- **Lin**: What?!
- **Lucy**: We needed **to escape**! We didn't want them to take the documents!
- **Lin**: What documents?
- **Lucy**: The documents in the suitcase.
- **Lin**: I don't understandâ€¦
- **Lucy**: Oh. I'm telling you the wrong story. This was when Grandpa and I were spies.
  - Forget I said **anything**.
