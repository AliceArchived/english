# A Difficult Person

Vikram and Priti are enjoying a peaceful breakfast.

Suddenly, a car horn beeps loudly outside their house.

- **Priti**: Who is making all of that noise so early in the morning?
- **Vikram**: That must be Justin.
- **Priti**: Your old college roommate?
- **Vikram**: Yes. I'm giving him a tour of the city today. He wants to buy a place here.
- **Priti**: You don't seem very excited.
- **Vikram**: Well, Justin is a difficult person. He's very…

The horn beeps four more times.

- **Priti**: Rude?

Vikram goes outside and sees Justin in a shiny new car.

Justin is wearing expensive designer clothes.

- **Justin**: Vikram! Wow. I forgot how small your house was! I keep telling you to get a bigger house, like mine!
- **Vikram**: Yes, I know. You sent me photos of your house… and your cars… and your boat.
- **Justin**: Should we take your car or mine?
- **Vikram**: I don't mind driving —

Justin suddenly starts laughing.

- **Justin**: I'm joking! We're not going to take your old car! Mine is much nicer!

Justin plays extremely loud music as they drive around town.

- **Vikram**: Maybe you'd like to buy a place near the park?

Justin turns down his music.

- **Justin**: Sorry! I couldn't hear you! The speakers in this new car are so loud!
- **Vikram**: Never mind.
  - Maybe you'll like downtown. That's where the clubs and restaurants are.

Vikram and Justin drive downtown. They get out of the car and walk around.

- **Justin**: The restaurants in my city are much cooler than these.
  - And the people are more fashionable.
  - I really live in the best city in the world!
- **Vikram**: Then why are you buying a place here?
- **Justin**: Because I don't have any friends there.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Can you describe Justin? How would you help him make friends?**

In my opinion, Justin seems **quite selfish** — he doesn’t **really** care about the people **around** him, which might **explain** why he feels lonely. If he wants to make real friends, he needs to be more **considerate** and avoid being rude. Building friendships **starts** with treating others kindly and showing some empathy.

在我看来，Justin 看起来有些自私 — 他并不怎么关心周围的人，这也许能解释他为什么会感到孤独。如果他想真正交到朋友，就需要更体贴一点，别那么粗鲁。建立友谊的关键，是要善待他人，并展现出一些同理心。

### Practice History

**Can you describe Justin? How would you help him make friends?**

I think Justin is a selfish person. He doesn't care about other people, so he should **be** lonely. If he wants to make friends, he should not **be** rude. He should think of other people.

> Corrections:

1. “he should be lonely” → 含义不明确，改为 “it’s not surprising that he feels lonely” 更自然、表达因果
2. “think of other people” → 更常见表达是 “think about others”

I think Justin is a selfish person. He doesn’t care about other people, so **it’s not surprising** that he **feels lonely**. If he wants to make friends, he shouldn’t **be** rude — he needs to think about others too.

我觉得 Justin 是一个自私的人。他不在乎别人，所以他感到孤独也不奇怪。如果他想交朋友，就不应该粗鲁，而是应该多为他人着想。
