# Astronaut Camp

Zari and Lily walk toward the **entrance** of a summer camp. They see a sign that says "JJ's Astronaut Adventures."

- **Zari**: We're finally at astronaut camp! This is going to be the best summer ever!
- **Lily**: I'd rather be home watching TV. This is going to be the worst summer ever.
- **Zari**: Lily, our generation will be the first to go to Mars! We need to learn how to be astronauts.

The owner of the camp, JJ, **overhears** their conversation.

- **JJ**: Actually, because of a lawsuit, we're not allowed to tell campers that we're training them to be astronauts.
- **Zari**: Oh… but we'll still learn about what it's like to go to space, right?
- **JJ**: Yes! You'll learn what it's like in space by bouncing on our zero gravity training device!

JJ points to a nearby trampoline.

- **Lily**: That's a broken trampoline.
- **Zari**: Lily, don't be rude! I'm sure they're fixing it.
- **JJ**: Uhh… Yeah, sure.
- **Zari**: So, when will we meet a real astronaut?
- **JJ**: Actually, the astronaut is going to a different **space-themed camp** that is willing to pay her.
  - But we have other fun activities!

JJ takes them to a muddy field.

- **JJ**: This field is basically the same as the **atmosphere** on Mars! Tomorrow, you'll spend the whole day here, digging up space rocks.
- **Lily**: Is digging up rocks really what astronauts would do on Mars?
- **JJ**: That's all there is to do on Mars.

Zari **nods**, and they continue walking.

- **JJ**: Welcome to your spaceships, where you'll be sleeping all summer!
- **Lily**: These are just cheap tents.
- **Zari**: This will teach us about becoming astronauts, right?
- **JJ**: Right! It'll be just like living on Mars because there's no **plumbing**!
- **Zari**: No plumbing?! How will we take showers?
- **JJ**: You won't! Because…
- **Lily**: Let me guess… astronauts don't shower?
- **Zari**: You were right, Lily. We can learn about space by watching "Space Viking" movies. Let's go home.
- **JJ**: You can leave, but you'll miss the greatest summer of your lives!
  - Also, refunds aren't allowed.

In my opinion, the best way to spend the summer is **by** taking time to **relax** and **recharge**. For children, though, it’s even better if they can take part in activities that are **not only** fun **but also** help them learn something new. A summer camp is a great option — there are so many different kinds available, so it’s important to choose one that suits their interests and personality.

我认为，度过夏天最好的方式就是放松身心、补充能量。但对于孩子来说，如果他们能参加一些既有趣又能学到新知识的活动，就更好了。夏令营就是一个非常不错的选择 — 有很多种类型可选，关键是找一个符合他们兴趣和个性的。

2.  Missing "to" in "would like spend" → should be "would like to spend".

> Corrections:

1. “do some things both fun and educational activities” is awkward and redundant. It should be simplified.
2. “A summer camp” should be integrated smoothly into the sentence.
3. “Choose what your kids like” is too abrupt.

In my opinion, holidays are better spent **relaxing**. But for kids, it’s great if they can do **activities** **that are** both fun and educational. A summer camp is a good idea — there are many **to choose from**, so pick one that matches your kids’ interests.

在我看来，假期最好是用来放松的。但对孩子来说，参加一些既有趣又有教育意义的活动是很不错的选择。夏令营就是一个好主意——有很多不同类型的营地，可以根据孩子的兴趣来选择。

> Corrections:

1. “your kids’ interests” 改为 “your child’s interests” 是为了让语气更通用、正式（不过原句也可接受）

In my opinion, holidays are better spent relaxing. But for kids, it’s great if they can do activities that are both fun and educational. A summer camp is a good idea — there are many to choose from, so it’s best to pick one that matches your **child’s** interests.

在我看来，假期最好的方式就是放松。但对于孩子来说，能做一些既有趣又有教育意义的活动是最理想的。参加夏令营是一个好主意 — 市面上有很多选择，可以选一个最符合孩子兴趣的。
