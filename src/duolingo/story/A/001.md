# A Big Commitment

Dear Elise,

Although I appreciate you asking me out, I couldn't possibly be your boyfriend. While I wish I could, we're both only eight years old.

And although I can do a lot of adult things, like order pizza with my dad's credit card, there's no way I'm ready for this kind of commitment.

I know I said yes in the moment, but that's only because you offered me a cookie, and I make bad decisions when I'm hungry.

At this age, we need to focus on ourselves. I saw the skateboarding alien you drew instead of taking notes in math class, and I think having a boyfriend would distract you from a successful career illustrating comic books.

Besides, as I've learned from my dad, dating only leads to heartbreak.

You have no idea how many times I've caught him eating all my ice cream after a difficult breakup.

But most importantly, my heart already belongs to someone else — my **neighbor**, Lily. She's in love with me, too. It might just take her ten years to realize it.

In conclusion, I'm not interested in dating anyone… except Lily.

Sorry,

Junior

## Sentences

- 在这个年纪，我们需要专注于自己。我看见了你在数学课上不记笔记而画的滑板外星人，我觉得谈恋爱会分散你成为漫画插画师的成功事业的注意力。
  - At this age, we need to focus on ourselves. I saw **the skateboarding alien** you drew instead of taking notes in math class, and I think having a boyfriend would distract you from **a successful career illustrating comic books**.

**Why did Junior say yes at first?**

**What do you think of Junior's reasons for not dating Elise? Why?**

I think Junior’s reasons **make sense**, since he’s still just a kid. What I really **respect** is that he knows how to **turn** someone **down** politely when he doesn’t feel the same way. That shows **maturity**, and for that reason, I’d rather not judge his choice.

我觉得 Junior 的理由是可以理解的，因为他毕竟还是个孩子。我很佩服的一点是，他在没有相同感受时，懂得如何礼貌地拒绝别人。这表现出一定的成熟，所以我不想去评判他的选择。

> Corrections:

It seems to me that he is still a **kid**. But it is good for him to refuse someone if he doesn't like them. And for **that** reason, I keep my opinion to myself.

1. “he is still a **kid**” → added “**just**” for emphasis and smoother tone
2. “if he doesn’t like them” → softened to “if he doesn’t feel the same” (more polite) “for **that** reason” → kept but rephrased the second sentence for flow

It seems to me that Junior is still **just** a **kid**, which makes sense. But it's good that he knows how to politely refuse someone if he doesn’t feel the same. **For that reason**, I respect his decision and prefer to keep my opinion to myself.
