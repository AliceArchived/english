# Art Camp - B2

Lily is sitting under a tree at a summer camp for artists. Suddenly, she feels a tap on her shoulder. It's her best friend, Zari.

- **Lily**: Zari? Why are you here?
- **Zari**: I missed you, so I came to visit! You don't have a new best friend already, do you?
- **Lily**: Of course not.
  - So… when **are you planning on** going home?
- **Zari**: I just got here, and you already want me to go home?
- **Lily**: I was just curious… Anyway, I'm hungry. Let's get lunch.

Lily and Zari arrive at the cafeteria.

- **Zari**: Let's sit over there!

Zari waves to a table of kids as Lily looks around nervously.

- **Lily**: Uhh… no. I was going to eat in the **painting studio**.
- **Zari**: Don't you want to introduce me to your friends?
- **Lily**: They seem busy.
- **Zari**: OK…

When Lily and Zari arrive at the studio, they see a few kids inside. Lily quickly turns away.

- **Lily**: Actually, I'd rather eat in my room.
- **Zari**: But I want to meet your friends!
- **Lily**: That's not going to happen.
- **Zari**: Lily, I came here to see you, but you don't want to introduce me to anyone!
  - Are you embarrassed of me because I'm not a cool artist like you and your new friends?
- **Lily**: I wasn't planning to tell you this… but I don't have any friends here. Everyone is cooler and more talented than I am.
- **Zari**: Lily, you're the coolest person I know.
- **Lily**: You must not know many people… But thanks. Come on, let's go to the cafeteria.

As Lily walks ahead, a group of kids run up to Zari.

- **Boy**: You know that girl?! She hasn't spoken to anyone all summer. She's so mysterious and cool.
- **Zari**: Yeah, but **just so you know**, she already has a best friend.

## Writing

### Do you think Zari is a good friend to Lily? Why or why not?

I believe that Zari is a good friend **to** Lily. Lily is not good with people. Zari actively **visits** Lily, **showing** she cares about Lily, and that will help Lily feel less **lonely**.

> "cares about Lily" → for smoother phrasing, it could be "cares about her" (referring back to Lily).

I believe that Zari is a good friend to Lily. Lily is not **good with** people. Zari **actively** visits Lily, showing she cares about **her**, and that will help Lily feel less lonely.

我认为 Zari 是 Lily 的好朋友。Lily 在人际关系方面不太擅长。Zari 主动去看 Lily，表现出她关心 Lily，这能帮助 Lily 感觉不那么孤单。

### Sentences

- 是啊，但只是让你知道一下，她已经有最好的朋友了。

  - “just so you know” 是常见的口语表达，用来提前声明或提醒对方一些可能重要的信息。语气微妙，有时也带点防御或警告意味，取决于语境。
