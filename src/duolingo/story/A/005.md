# A Letter to Eddy

Dearest Father,

**There comes** a time in every kid's life when he must let his father go out into the world and become independent.

For me, that time is now.

Therefore, as your loving son, I'm urging you to pursue your dream of acting in a toilet paper commercial.

I want you to know that you can enjoy taking trips to exciting film locations around the world without worrying about me because I'm totally **self-sufficient**.

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are under control thanks to an app I have for ordering pizza and a closet full of candy that I've been hiding from you for years.

I'll admit that I'm a little sad to **let** my dad **go out** into the big scary world alone, but I think you'll be fine… probably.

Just remember that it's alright to make mistakes — and if history tells us anything, you'll make a lot of mistakes.

I do have two important **pieces** of advice: don't fall in love with your co-star(who, according to the script for the commercial, will be wearing a toilet paper costume), and never allow anyone to pay you in toilet paper instead of money.

In closing, I encourage you to take the job and **discover your potential**.

Our apartment will feel empty and **quiet** without your daily workout sessions, but at least I'll have **uninterrupted access to** the TV.

Your loving **son**,

Junior

### Writing

#### Do you think Junior gave Eddy good advice? Why or why not?

In my opinion, ~~these~~ advice ~~are~~ just some interesting thoughts from a kid. It shows his opinion, such as he doesn't want his dad to date someone in the commercial, but whether or not Eddy dates with someone depends on Eddy.

In my opinion, **this** advice **is** just some interesting thoughts from a kid. It shows his opinion, ~~such as~~ he doesn't want his dad to date someone in the commercial, but whether or not Eddy dates ~~with~~ someone depends on Eddy.

> - “just some interesting thoughts” would sound more natural as “are just some interesting thoughts.”
> - “such as he doesn’t want…” → better phrased as “like not wanting his dad…”
> - “whether or not Eddy dates with someone” → “dates someone” is the correct phrasing (no “with”).

In my opinion, **this** advice **is** just some interesting thoughts from a kid. It shows his opinion, **like** not wanting his dad to date someone in the commercial, but whether or not Eddy **dates someone** depends on Eddy.
