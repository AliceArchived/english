# A Fancy Wedding

Lucy and her granddaughter Lin are at a fancy wedding.

- **Lucy**: There are too many flowers here. At your mother's wedding, there was one simple rose on every table.
- **Lin**: Shhh! Grandma, be quiet! The bride will **hear** you.
- **Lucy**: Achoo! Good! She should know there are too many flowers. I can't stop sneezing!
- **Lin**: I think the flowers are nice.
- **Lucy**: But they don't match these silver plates.
- **Lin**: I think the silver plates are fancy.
- **Lucy**: At your mother's wedding, there were gold plates.
- **Lin**: Oh, I didn't know that… Tell me more about Mom's wedding.
- **Lucy**: I've never told you anything about it?
  - Well, all the men **wore** blue suits.
- **Lin**: That sounds very stylish!
- **Lucy**: And there was a violin player.
- **Lin**: Wow. That's romantic.
- **Lucy**: And during the ceremony, your mother sang a song for your father.
- **Lin**: Really? My mom did that?
- **Lucy**: Yes!
- **Lin**: Grandma… are you crying?
  - Wow, my parents' wedding sounds like it was really beautiful.
- **Lucy**: No, that's not why I'm crying.
  - I'm crying because I just saw that there's no cake.

### Practice History

**Lin's parents had a fancy wedding. Do you like fancy events? Why or why not?**

Yes, I like fancy events. Our daily life is plain, we need some special moments. Let's add some color **to** our life.

> Corrections:

1. “Our daily life is plain” → 语法上可以接受，但表达略显单薄
2. “we need some special moments” → 句子结构可以更自然
3. “Let’s add some color in our life.” → 应为 “add some color **to** our life”（介词错误）

Yes, I like fancy events. **Everyday life** can be **quite ordinary**, so I think we all need some special moments **from time to time**. They bring excitement and help us create lasting memories — it’s a great way to add some color to our lives.
