# A True Expert

Oscar and Vikram are shopping at a flea market.

- **Vikram**: Oscar, I finally found the painting I want to buy for my living room! You're the art expert. Do you approve?
- **Oscar**: Absolutely not! Your wife sent me to make sure you didn't buy something boring or hideous.
  - And this one's both! The painting is boring, and the frame is **hideous**.
- **Vikram**: No, it's not!
- **Oscar**: But it's just a simple painting of a man and woman in front of a barn.
- **Vikram**: But they're in love. That's so sweet!
- **Oscar**: How do you know they're in love? Maybe they're just friends.
- **Vikram**: OK, even if they're just friends, I still like this painting.
- **Oscar**: Sorry, if I let you buy that, your wife will never trust me again!

The vendor approaches Vikram.

- **Vendor**: Hello, are you interested in this painting?
- **Vikram**: Yes! How much is it?
- **Vendor**: $100.
- **Vikram**: Perfect! I'd love to —
- **Oscar**: Absolutely not!
  - Vikram, I'm the expert here, so I'm going to negotiate.
  - How about $10? Do we have a deal?
- **Vendor**: $85 is my final offer.
- **Oscar**: Sir, we're leaving!

Oscar **dramatically** grabs Vikram's arm and leads him away.

- **Vikram**: What are you doing?!
- **Oscar**: Don't worry. If they see you walk away, they always lower the price to get you to come back.
- **Vikram**: But look, someone else is interested in my painting!

Another customer approaches the vendor and picks up the painting. Vikram runs over to her as she pays for it.

- **Vikram**: Wait! Don't buy that painting. I'll pay $200 for it!
- **Woman**: Oh, did you want this painting?

The woman removes the painting from the frame and hands it to Vikram.

- **Vikram**: You're giving me the painting for free?
- **Woman**: Sure, I only want the frame because it's worth thousands of dollars!
- **Oscar**: What?
- **Woman**: It's a valuable antique, but only a true expert would know that.

**Would you trust Oscar to help you buy a painting? Why or why not?**

No, I wouldn’t trust Oscar to help me choose a painting. In the story, he stopped Vikram from buying a **piece** he really liked, claiming it wasn’t valuable. However, **that exact painting** was later bought by a **professional art expert**, who recognized that the frame was actually an antique worth thousands of dollars. This shows that Oscar lacks the **experience** and **judgment** needed for something like art buying.

不，我不会相信 Oscar 来帮我挑选画作。在故事中，他阻止 Vikram 买下一幅他非常喜欢的画，说那幅画不值钱。但那幅画后来被一位专业的艺术专家买下了，专家还发现画框其实是一件值几千美元的古董。这说明 Oscar 并不具备购买艺术品所需要的经验和判断力。

Why say "a piece" instead of "a piece of painting"?

1. "A piece" = a work of art (natural expression)
   - In English, “a piece” is a common and natural shorthand for:
     - a piece of artwork
     - a painting
     - a sculpture
     - a musical composition
   - So, when we say:
     - “He wanted to buy a piece he really liked,”
     - it’s completely normal and correct — “a piece” = one painting.
2. ❌ “A piece of painting” is incorrect
   - “Painting” is a countable noun in this context.
   - You don’t say “a piece of a painting” unless you literally mean a torn or damaged part of it!
   - 🔻 Example of incorrect use:
     - ❌ “I want to buy a piece of painting.”
     - ✳️ Implies you're buying a fragment of a painting — sounds wrong or odd.
     - ✅ Better options:
       - “a painting”
       - “a piece” (natural, fluent)
       - “a work of art” (more formal)

### Practice History

**Would you trust Oscar to help you buy a painting? Why or why not?**

No, I wouldn't trust Oscar to help me buy a painting. According to the story, Oscar made a wrong decision not to allow Vikram to buy a painting he liked. And that painting was bought by a true expert who said the frame is an antique and worth ~~thouands~~ of dollars.

> Corrections:

1. “Oscar made a wrong decision not to allow Vikram to buy…” → awkward; better phrasing: “**made the wrong decision by stopping Vikram…**”
2. “the frame is an antique and worth thouands” → typo: **“thousands”**
3. “And that painting was bought by a true expert” → stylistically weak with “And”; better to connect it more smoothly

No, I wouldn’t trust Oscar to help me buy a painting. According to the story, **he** made the wrong decision **by stopping** Vikram **from** buying a painting he liked. That **same painting** was **later** bought by a real **art expert**, who said the frame was an antique worth thousands of dollars.
