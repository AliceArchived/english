# A Perfect Anniversary

Vikram walks into a jewelry store.

- **Sales**: Hello, how can I help you?
- **Vikram**: Hi! I need help with something very special.
  - I just drove all the way to this city. Twenty years ago, I met my wife here!
- **Sales**: Wow! Twenty years is such a long time!
- **Vikram**: Yes, it is! I'm planning the perfect anniversary.
- **Sales**: Great, I can help you with that!
- **Vikram**: Thanks! So, I'm looking for…
- **Sales**: Don't tell me! I already know.
- **Vikram**: You do?
- **Sales**: Yes! You need a silver necklace! You can take your wife on a boat at sunset and give it to her. That will be very romantic.
- **Vikram**: Actually, no…
- **Sales**: You're right. The anniversary has to be perfect.
  - A gold necklace is much better!
- **Vikram**: No, no…
- **Sales**: Earrings? Look at these beautiful diamond earrings here.
- **Vikram**: Diamond earrings? No. We don't usually spend more than five dollars on anniversary presents.
- **Sales**: What?
- **Vikram**: We love each other and we don't care about fancy presents.
- **Sales**: Then why are you in a jewelry store?

Vikram takes a **napkin** out of his pocket. It has the name of a sandwich shop on it.

- **Vikram**: Do you know where this sandwich shop is? I can't find the address online. I need to buy my wife a sandwich there for our anniversary.
- **Sales**: A sandwich? That's not very romantic.
- **Vikram**: Well, we shared a sandwich there on our first date.
- **Sales**: You kept this napkin for twenty years?!
- **Vikram**: Yes! I have loved her since we shared that sandwich.
- **Sales**: OK… maybe that is romantic.

## Speaking

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0–7.5

**Are you like Vikram in this story? Are you a romantic person? Why?**

No, I don’t think I’m like Vikram at all. Honestly, I couldn’t really **relate to** him, and I’m sure I wouldn’t appreciate someone like that. I’m not a romantic person. I just can’t imagine someone keeping a napkin for twenty years. When I read that part, my first thought was that the napkin must be made of cloth—because if it were paper, it would’ve **disintegrated** by now. So yeah, I’m definitely **not a romantic type**.

不，我觉得我一点也不像 Vikram。老实说，我完全无法共情他的行为，也不太能欣赏那种人。我并不是一个浪漫的人。我完全无法想象有人会把一张餐巾纸留二十年。我读到那段时，第一个反应是：“这餐巾纸肯定是布做的吧？要是纸的早就烂了。”所以没错，我绝对不是那种浪漫型的人。

- disintegrate： 英 /dɪsˈɪntɪɡreɪt/ 美 /dɪsˈɪntɪɡreɪt/
  - vt. & vi. (使)破裂〔分裂，粉碎〕；(使)崩溃

### 审题

在 IELTS 口语中，这类问题的 “**Are you like…**” 通常有两个可能的意思：

| 理解方式                  | 含义                                     | 举例解释                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **性格或行为是否相似** | 你和 Vikram 在性格、做法上有没有相似之处 | 比如你也会保留有纪念意义的东西，那你就是 “like Vikram”         |
| ❌ 是否“理解”或“欣赏”他   | 你是否能接受他这种人                     | 这不完全是“like”，更像是 “Do you agree with him / admire him?” |

Are you similar to Vikram in how you think or act?
→ **你和他有相似的行为或性格特征吗？**

### 推荐回答结构：

No, I’m not like Vikram at all.
I don’t think I would ever keep a napkin for twenty years just because it had emotional meaning.
I’m not the romantic type, and I don’t usually hold on to objects for sentimental reasons.

### Practice History

**Are you like Vikram in this story? Are you a romantic person? Why?**

No, I don't understand Vikram in this story, and sure I can't appreciate him.I'm not a romantic person. I just can't imagine someone keep a napkin for twenty years. When I read this my first thought is the napkin must made of cloth, not a paper napkin. So sure, I'm not romantic.

> Corrections:

1. “and sure I can't appreciate him”
   - → 语法不自然，建议改为 “and I’m sure I wouldn’t appreciate someone like him.”
2. “someone keep”
   - → 主谓不一致，应为 “someone keeping”。
3. “When I read this, my first thought is”
   - “is” → 建议改为过去时 “was”，与上下文一致。
4. “must made of cloth”
   - → 时态错误，应为 “must be made of cloth”。
5. “So sure, I'm not romantic.”
   - → 语气不自然，建议改为 “So yeah, I’m definitely not a romantic person.”
