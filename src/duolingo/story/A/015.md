# Aliens Are Real

Eddy and his son, Junior, are in their apartment.

They are arguing.

- **Eddy**: I think believing in **aliens** is crazy.
- **Junior**: Crazy?
  - Thousands of people have seen aliens.
- **Eddy**: Thousands of people can be wrong.
- **Junior**: The government says aliens are real.
- **Eddy**: The government is wrong about a lot of things.
- **Junior**: Do you know how big the universe is?
- **Eddy**: It's pretty big.
- **Junior**: Pretty big?
  - There are billions of planets.
- **Eddy**: So?
- **Junior**: There are definitely aliens on one of those planets.
- **Eddy**: We'll never know.
- **Junior**: All the smartest scientists believe aliens are real.
- **Eddy**: None of the scientists I know believe in aliens.
- **Junior**: How many scientists do you know?
- **Eddy**: OK, I don't know any scientists…
- **Junior**: Dad, you know it's possible that aliens are real.
- **Eddy**: Fine, maybe it's possible.
  - But I still don't believe that aliens ate all of my **favorite** cereal. (British, favourite)
- **Junior**: How do you know that, Dad?
- **Eddy**: I believe in what I see. And I see milk on your shirt.
- **Junior**: What?

Junior looks down at his shirt.

- **Junior**: OK, you win. I ate your cereal.
  - But I still think aliens are real.

### Writing

#### Junior thinks aliens exist. Do you think they're real? Why?

Yes, I think aliens exist. The universe is so huge. It is possible that aliens ~~are~~ exist. And there are so many ancient **heritages**. **The** technology **is** so complicated, and **it is** difficult for people today to make them. **It** is highly possible that aliens made them.

> 1. “aliens are exist” → 语法错误，应为 **aliens exist** 或 **aliens might exist**，不能同时用 "are" 和 "exist"。
> 2. “heritages” 用词不当，应为 **“structures”**、**“sites”** 或 **“artifacts”**。 “heritage” 通常是不可数名词，表示文化遗产整体。
> 3. “The technology is so complicated” 语法没错，但建议明确指代：**“Some ancient technologies are so complicated”**。
> 4. “It is difficult for people today to make them.” → 更自然写法是 **"even people today would struggle to build them."**

Yes, I think aliens exist. The universe is so huge **that** it's possible **life** exists **elsewhere**. **Also**, there are many **ancient structures and artifacts** with technology so **advanced** that even people today would struggle to build them. It's highly possible that aliens had something to do with them.

是的，我认为外星人存在。宇宙如此庞大，其他地方存在生命是有可能的。而且，很多古代建筑和遗迹中展现出的技术非常先进，甚至现代人也难以复制。这些很可能与外星人有关。

> - **“the earth”** → 在这里，地球作天体专有名词用时要大写为 **“Earth”**，前面**不用加 “the”**。
> - **“on ancient days”** → 应为 **“in ancient times”**。
> - **“did them”** → 应为 **“created those things”** 更自然。

Yes, I think aliens are real. The universe is so huge, **Earth** can't be the only place with **intelligent creatures**. **Also**, there are wonders like the pyramids **—** **in ancient times**, people didn’t have the technology to build them. If aliens don’t exist, then who created those things?

是的，我相信外星人是真实存在的。宇宙如此广阔，地球不可能是唯一有智慧生物的地方。而且像金字塔这样的奇迹，古代人类根本没有能力建造。如果没有外星人，那是谁建造的这些东西呢？
