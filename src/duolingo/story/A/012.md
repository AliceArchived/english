# A Wedding Story

Lucy and Lin are at a family wedding.

- **Lucy**: This is a beautiful wedding!
- **Lin**: I know! This hotel is amazing!
- **Lucy**: And the food is delicious!
- **Lin**: Are these gold forks?
- **Lucy**: Yes!
- **Lin**: This wedding **is** probably very expensive.
- **Lucy**: How much do you think it cost?
- **Lin**: A lot.
- **Lucy**: Your cousin, Paul, hates spending money!
  - I'm surprised that the wedding is so nice.
- **Lin**: I'm surprised that the bride is so beautiful.
  - I just talked to the bride. Did you know she's a doctor?
- **Lucy**: How did Paul meet such an amazing woman?
- **Lin**: I don't know! He isn't good enough for her.
- **Lucy**: He looks like a potato.
- **Lin**: And he's lazy.
- **Lucy**: But it's nice that he invited us!
- **Lin**: Be quiet! He's coming here.
- **Lucy**: Wait. That's not Paul.
- **Lin**: You're right! I think we're **at** the wrong hotel! Let's go.
- **Lucy**: No, let's stay here. It's time for dessert!
