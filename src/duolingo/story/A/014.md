# Airport Vacation

Lily and Zari are at the airport. They're on vacation with Zari's family. Zari's mom walks over to them.

- **Mom**: Sorry, girls. Our flight is delayed for three hours.
- **Lily**: Three more hours?! I hate **airports**.
- **Zari**: This airport is really big. Maybe we can find something cool to do.
- **Lily**: There's nothing cool at an airport.
- **Zari**: Maybe we can go to that clothing store.
- **Lily**: No one **buys** **clothes** at airports. (~~buy~~)(~~cloth~~)

Later, Lily is wearing a new T-shirt.

- **Zari**: I like your new T-shirt, Lily.
- **Lily**: Be quiet.
- **Zari**: Are you hungry?
- **Lily**: Yes, but I don't eat food **in** **airports**. (~~airport~~)
- **Zari**: There's a Japanese restaurant near the spa.
- **Lily**: There's a spa here?
- **Zari**: They have everything!

Later, Lily and Zari are eating big bowls of noodles at the Japanese restaurant.

- **Lily**: OK, I love this airport.
- **Zari**: Yeah, but now I'm tired.
- **Lily**: I know where we can go.

Later, Zari's mom is looking for the two girls. She finds them sitting in massage chairs at the spa.

- **Mom**: Come on, girls, our plane is leaving soon!
- **Zari**: Can we stay here?
- **Mom**: What about our vacation?
- **Lily**: This is the best vacation I've ever had.
