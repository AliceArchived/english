# I Can Do Anything

Eddy and Bea are playing tennis.

- **Eddy**: Thanks for meeting me, Bea. I'm feeling very sad lately.
  - All of my friends from college are so successful, but I'm not.

Eddy hits the ball.

- **Eddy**: It's time for a change in my life.
- **Bea**: Please don't buy an expensive car or start wearing tight jeans.
- **Eddy**: Are you joking? I don't have enough money for a fancy car.

Eddy and Bea sit down on **a** **bench**.

- **Bea**: Eddy, are you crying? Or is that sweat on your face?
- **Eddy**: Both!
  - I never did anything important, and now it's too late.
- **Bea**: Eddy, it's not too late!
  - You can do something important now!
- **Eddy**: You don't think I'm too old?
- **Bea**: No, you just need to work hard.
- **Eddy**: I can work hard!
- **Bea**: Great. Then just say, "I can do anything!"
- **Eddy**: I can do anything!
- **Bea**: That's right, Eddy!
- **Eddy**: And I'm going to be an Olympic tennis player!
- **Bea**: What!?
- **Eddy**: The Olympics are next summer. I need to practice more.
  - Can you meet me here every day?
- **Bea**: Uh, well... It's really hard to become an Olympic athlete, Eddy...
- **Eddy**: So you don't think I'm good enough?
- **Bea**: I think you're great. But Olympic athletes start training at a very young age... Like your son Junior's age.
- **Eddy**: You're right!
- **Bea**: Huh?
- **Eddy**: It's not too late for Junior! I'll make him practice every day, and then he'll be an Olympic tennis player!
- **Bea**: Um, Eddy, are we talking about the same Junior who only goes outside to buy video games?!
