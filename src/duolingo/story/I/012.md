# I'm Innocent - B2

From: lily@duomail.co

To: Always 22 Management

**Subject: Stolen Sweater**

To Whom It May Concern,

I'm writing this email firstly because I hate talking to people in person.

Secondly, I'm writing to defend myself against ridiculous accusations that I stole a sweater from the store on Friday night. I'm **offended** by this **claim**.

I've been an employee at this store for several years, so everyone should know I would never do that.

More importantly, I would never, ever steal a sweater that's my least favorite color: yellow.

Trust me, I would have liked nothing more than to never see that sweater in the store again, but I didn't steal it.

In all my time working here, I've never even folded an **article** of yellow clothing. That's how much I hate that color. Sure, I might not fold the other clothes either, but that's not important.

Do you need more proof that I didn't steal the sweater? I left four hours before my shift ended on Friday. Ask Phoebe, the other sales associate working during my **shift**.

She should remember because she was pretty annoyed when I told her I was leaving to go to a concert.

Also, I heard Phoebe loves yellow sweaters.

Sincerely offended,

Lily

## Writing

### Do you believe Lily didn't steal the sweater? Why or why not?

In my opinion, Lily didn't steal the sweater. She is a cool girl with high **self-respect**. She may not treat others well, but surely she has higher standards **for** other people or **for** herself.

1. **“with high self-respect”** ✔️ 虽然语法正确，但表达略显生硬。更自然的说法是： ✅ **“She has a strong sense of self-respect.”**
2. **“She may not treat others well, but surely she has higher standards for other people or for herself.”** “for other people or for herself” 逻辑有些不清晰，似乎不确定主语是谁。 ✅ 建议更清楚地表达，比如：
3. **“…but she clearly holds herself to high standards, even if she’s not always kind to others.”**

In my opinion, Lily didn’t steal the sweater. She seems like a **confident** girl with **strong self-respect**. Even if she doesn’t always treat others nicely, she clearly **holds** both herself and others to high standards, so I don’t believe she would do something like stealing.

在我看来，Lily 没有偷那件毛衣。她看起来是个自信、有自尊的女孩。即使她不总是对别人很友善，但她对自己和他人都有很高的要求，我不认为她会去偷东西。

In my opinion, Lily didn’t steal the sweater. She seems like a **confident girl** with a **strong sense of self-respect**. Even if she doesn’t always treat others kindly, she **holds high standards** for both herself and the people around her. I don’t think someone like that would do something dishonest.

在我看来，Lily 没有偷那件毛衣。她看起来是个自信、有自尊的女孩。即使她不总是善待别人，她对自己和他人都有很高的标准。我不认为这样的人会做出不诚实的事。

自然、逻辑清晰的回答：

Yes, I believe Lily didn’t steal the sweater. In the story, she writes an email **denying** the **accusation** and says she is **offended** by the **claim**. She explains that she has worked at the store for years and would never steal, especially not a yellow sweater—which she says is her least favorite color. She even says she’s never folded any yellow clothing and left work early that day. Her explanation sounds clear and sincere.

是的，我相信 Lily 没有偷那件毛衣。在故事中，她写了一封邮件否认指控，并表示自己对这种说法感到愤怒。她解释说，她在这家店工作了好几年，绝不会偷东西，尤其不会偷一件黄色的毛衣——因为那是她最讨厌的颜色。她还说自己从来没叠过任何黄色的衣服，而且当天提前下班了。她的解释听起来清晰而真诚。

#### Minor stylistic/punctuation suggestions:

1. **"I'm writing this email firstly because…"**
   - While "firstly" is technically correct, in modern usage, it's more natural to just say:
     ✅ **"First, I'm writing this email because…"**
     (Especially since there's no “thirdly” later.)
2. **"Sure, I might not fold the other clothes either, but that's not important."**
   - This sentence is **grammatically fine**, but if you want a smoother flow:
     ✅ _“Sure, I don’t really fold the other clothes either, but that’s beside the point.”_
     ("beside the point" is a more idiomatic phrase)
