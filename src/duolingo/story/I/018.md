# Is She Mad at me?

Lily and Zari are eating lunch at school. Zari stares at her phone.

- **Zari**: This is awful. I texted Maggie to ask if she wanted to hang out this weekend, but she's ignoring me.
- **Lily**: Wait. I thought we were hanging out this weekend. We're going to a concert.
- **Zari**: I want Maggie to come too!
- **Lily**: The last time we went to a concert with her, she sang louder than the band!
- **Zari**: Lily, don't be mean. Why hasn't Maggie texted me back? Is she mad at me?
- **Lily**: Why would anyone be mad at you?
- **Zari**: Maybe it's because we wore the same sweater yesterday.
- **Lily**: Even I have that sweater.
- **Zari**: Or maybe it's because I got a better grade than her in math class?
- **Lily**: You get better grades than everybody.
- **Zari**: Oh no! There she is.

Zari stands up and nervously waves at Maggie. Maggie **looks away**.

- **Zari**: Did you see that? She is mad at me!
- **Lily**: Wow, I think you're right…

Lily angrily walks over to Maggie.

Maggie tries to hide her face with a textbook.

- **Lily**: Uhh… I can still see you.
- **Maggie**: Hi, Lily.
- **Lily**: Why are you ignoring Zari?
- **Maggie**: I'm not ignoring her…
- **Lily**: But Zari said you haven't texted her back.
- **Maggie**: Yeah, because… I don't want to hang out with you.
- **Lily**: Wait, you haven't been hanging out with Zari because of me?
- **Maggie**: Yes, you're always so mean.
- **Lily**: Oh… Sorry….
  - Please come to the concert.
  - Zari and I both want you to come.
- **Maggie**: Really? Great! We're going to have so much fun singing every song!
- **Lily**: Great…

Lily walks back to Zari.

- **Zari**: What did she say? Was she mad at me?
- **Lily**: Uh… yeah, but don't worry. I fixed everything.

Yes, I love to hang out with a girl like Maggie. She's full of energy and this kind of person **is** always the type I like.

> Corrections:

1. "this kind of person **is** always the type I like" sounds awkward and redundant.

Yes, I love to hang out with a girl like Maggie. She's full of energy, and **that kind of person is exactly the type I like**.

---

Yes, I love this kind of girl. She seems like someone with **enthusiasm**, that kind of person **is** always sunny and likes **to** smile. She is probably funny too.

> Corrections:

1. "this kind of girl" is fine, but "I love this kind of girl" sounds a bit awkward — "I really like girls like her" is more natural.
2. "someone with enthusiasm" is okay, but "full of enthusiasm" is smoother.
3. "that kind of person **is** always sunny" → better as "that kind of person **tends to be** sunny" for a softer, more accurate tone.
4. "likes **to** smile" is grammatically fine, but "always smiling" might flow better.

Yes, I really like girls like her. She seems like someone **full of enthusiasm**. That kind of person **tends to be cheerful** and is always smiling. She's probably funny too.

> Your answer: You talked about liking girls like her, but the question is asking whether you yourself are like her, not whether you admire her.
> So — your answer doesn’t directly respond to the question. It shifts the focus to admiration instead of self-comparison.

Yes, I’m a lot like Maggie. I love singing along to all the songs at concerts — it makes me feel connected to the music and the crowd. People like us are usually full of energy and enjoy expressing ourselves.

This version directly answers “**Are you like her?**” by using first-person reflection, and keeps the enthusiastic tone.

Yes, I like Maggie. I love **listening** to someone sing songs at concerts. That's what **really makes** a concert different from **just** listening to songs in other places. People can get involved.

> Corrections:

1. “That’s what really makes a concert different from just listening to songs in other places.” → 虽然语法正确，但可以更精炼流畅
2. “People can get involved.” → 句子过于简短，建议稍作扩展增强表达效果

Yes, I like Maggie. I really **enjoy listening** to someone sing **live** at a concert — that’s what makes it so **special** **compared to** just listening to music **elsewhere**. At a concert, people can truly get involved and feel the energy of the performance.

Yes, I like Maggie. I also enjoy listening to live music at concerts, just like she does. That’s what really makes a concert special compared to simply listening to songs somewhere else — the atmosphere, the crowd, and the feeling of being part of something. It allows people to fully engage and enjoy music together.
