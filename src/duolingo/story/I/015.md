# Inhale, Exhale

Oscar is lying on the sofa at his therapist's office. The therapist is taking notes.

- **Therapist**: So, how are you feeling today?
- **Oscar**: I am feeling stressed!

The therapist nods her head.

- **Therapist**: And what is making you feel stressed?
- **Oscar**: Everything! Don't you watch the news?!
- **Therapist**: OK. Try to stay calm. **Inhale** slowly and then **exhale**.

Oscar inhales and then exhales. He shakes his head.

- **Oscar**: No. This isn't helping! I don't like hearing myself breathe.
- **Therapist**: I see. Then, what is something that helps you feel calm?
- **Oscar**: I don't ever feel calm.

The therapist smiles patiently.

- **Therapist**: You could try to **meditate**.
- **Oscar**: No. I don't have time to sit and do nothing!
- **Therapist**: Maybe you need something more active. Have you tried yoga?
- **Oscar**: Yes. But I hate the music yoga teachers play. And anyway, I can't touch my toes!

The therapist takes a deep breath.

- **Therapist**: You could take a long, hot bath to relax...
- **Oscar**: By the time I relax, the water is always cold!
- **Therapist**: OK. Try to stay calm. Inhale, exhale.

Oscar's therapist tries one more suggestion.

- **Therapist**: You could go to the beach.
  - Everyone likes a little bit of sun.
- **Oscar**: Not me! The last time I went to the beach, I got a sunburn and all of my students called me Mr. Tomato!
  - I hate being called Mr. Tomato!
- **Therapist**: Oscar! You're shouting again!

She puts her notebook down.

- **Therapist**: I think I know something that will help you feel more relaxed.

Oscar and his therapist walk outside. They count to three, and then they both scream loudly.

- **Therapist**: Ah!
- **Oscar**: Ah!
  - You're right! I do feel more relaxed now.
- **Therapist**: I do, too.

## Writing

### Oscar is looking for a way to relax. How do you usually relax?

Usually, I do exercise to **relax**. Exercise really helps.

Usually, I exercise and sleep ~~to get relaxed~~. Since my job usually only ~~needs~~ me to sit down and just ~~thinking~~, using computer.

Usually, I exercise and sleep to relax. Since my job **usually** only **requires** me to sit down and **think**, using **the** computer.

> - “Since my job usually only requires me to sit down and think, using the computer.” is a sentence fragment. It lacks a main clause.
> - “using the computer” is awkwardly attached and should be rephrased for clarity.

Usually, I do exercise to relax. It's difficult to relax by **talking** to other people, and it always makes things worse. But by doing exercise, it works and it's safe.

> - “it always makes things worse” 建议具体说明“what things”，否则略显模糊。
> - “But by doing exercise, it works and it's safe.” 语法不够自然，可重写为更清晰的表达。

Usually, I do exercise to relax. **It's** difficult for me to relax by talking to other people—it **often** makes things worse. But exercise really works for me, and it feels safe.

我通常通过锻炼来放松。和别人交谈对我来说很难放松，反而常常让事情变得更糟。但锻炼对我来说确实有效，而且让我感到安全。
