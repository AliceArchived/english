# Is This Love?

It's time for a new episode of the dating show, “Is This Love?”

Eddy met many women on the show… Now he has to choose one!

Right now, he's talking to Rose.

- **Eddy**: I can't believe that I have to choose. This is stressful.
- **Rose**: It's easy. Choose me.
- **Eddy**: But it's a difficult decision …
- **Rose**: Really?
  - I thought that you liked me …
- **Eddy**: I do! But … I like Megan too …
- **Rose**: Well, Megan is beautiful.
- **Eddy**: She's intelligent and funny …
- **Rose**: She's also a great guitar player.
- **Eddy**: I know! You both love music.
- **Rose**: Yeah, we are very similar…
- **Eddy**: Yes! You both love funny movies and art museums.
  - And you both write poetry!
- **Rose**: Yes, her poetry is very beautiful …
- **Eddy**: I don't know what to do!
- **Rose**: I know what you should do …
- **Eddy**: Tell me!
- **Rose**: Don't choose me or Megan. Choose someone else!
- **Eddy**: What?! Why?
- **Rose**: Because … I want to choose Megan.
- **Eddy**: Huh?

On the next episode of “Is This Love?” … what will Megan say?!
