# I Love Boxing

Lin and Oscar are in a coffee shop.

Oscar is telling Lin a story when he notices that she's asleep.

- **Oscar**: Lin, are you **asleep**?
- **Lin**: What? Oh … Sorry. I've been very tired lately.
- **Oscar**: Oh, I know what will help you.
- **Lin**: What?
- **Oscar**: I just started boxing classes!
  - You should come with me tomorrow. I promise, it will give you more energy.

The next day, Lin meets Oscar outside his boxing class.

Oscar is wearing shorts and boxing gloves.

- **Lin**: Wow, you have your own boxing gloves?
- **Oscar**: Of course! I'm a real boxer! Now, let's go inside.

Later, Lin is in the class. She looks tired. The teacher walks over to her.

- **Teacher**: Are you OK?
- **Lin**: No, I'm extremely tired. I don't have any more energy.
- **Teacher**: Are you new to this class?
- **Lin**: Yeah, Oscar invited me.
- **Teacher**: Who's Oscar?
- **Lin**: That man over there.

Lin looks around the room. Oscar is gone.

Lin finds Oscar drinking a **smoothie** at the store next to the gym.

- **Lin**: Oscar, what are you doing?
- **Oscar**: After class, I always get a smoothie.
- **Lin**: But you didn't finish the class.
- **Oscar**: I finished half of it. I'll do the whole class next time. That was only my third class.
- **Lin**: You've only been to three boxing classes?
- **Oscar**: Yeah, the class is OK, but this smoothie has changed my life! Here, taste it.

Lin drinks some of the smoothie.

- **Lin**: Wow, how much sugar is in this?
- **Oscar**: Two hundred grams. And as much **caffeine** as three cups of coffee.
  - Don't you feel great?!
- **Lin**: Yeah, I love boxing!

## Writing

### What happened in this story? Tell us.

In this story, there is ~~some~~ a mismatch the author made on purpose. At the beginning, it makes readers think it should be a very good boxing class, but ~~at~~ the end, what really works is actually a smoothie.

In this story, there is **a** mismatch the author made on purpose. At the beginning, it makes readers think it should be a very good boxing class, but **in** the end, what really works is actually a smoothie.

> - “there is **a** mismatch” → better phrased as **“there is a deliberate mismatch”** for clarity.
> - “At the beginning, it makes readers think it should be a very good boxing class” → smoother as **“At first, it makes readers think the boxing class is very good.”**
> - “but **in** the end” → correct, but it’s better to connect smoothly.
> - “what really works is actually a smoothie” → fine, but could sound even clearer as **“it turns out that what really works is a smoothie.”**

In this story, there is **a deliberate mismatch** created by the author. **At first**, it makes readers think the boxing class is very good, but in the end, **it turns out** that what really works is actually a smoothie.

在这个故事中，作者故意制造了一个错位。一开始让读者以为拳击课非常棒，但最后真正起作用的其实是一杯奶昔。
