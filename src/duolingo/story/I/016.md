# Is This a Date?

Junior and Lily are at a museum.

- **Lily**: This museum is pretty cool…
- **Junior**: It's a really great museum! And this is a great date!
- **Lily**: What? Junior, this is not a date.
- **Junior**: But it's just the two of us. Alone!
- **Lily**: That doesn't mean it's a date.
  - We went to the library together on Wednesday, and that wasn't a date.
- **Junior**: Wait… that wasn't a date either?
- **Lily**: No, Junior! I'm your babysitter, not your **date**.
- **Junior**: Well, I'm confused. What usually happens during a date?
- **Lily**: Well, uh… A date happens at a place like… a restaurant.
- **Junior**: But we went to a sandwich shop for lunch!
- **Lily**: No, not a sandwich shop. A fancy restaurant.
- **Junior**: But you bought my sandwich…
- **Lily**: Your dad gave me the money for your sandwich.
  - It's also the afternoon right now. Dates don't happen during the day.

A week later, Junior sees Lily at the movie theater.

- **Junior**: Hi Lily! You're seeing this movie too?
- **Lily**: Oh, hi, Junior.
- **Junior**: Wow, that's a lot of popcorn for one person.
- **Lily**: OK, you can sit next to me and eat some of my popcorn.
  - But not talking. And remember—
- **Junior**: I know, I know. It's not a date!
  - Anyway, I already have a date tonight.

Zari **walks over** to Junior and Lily. She has two sodas and a box of candy.

- **Zari**: Look, Junior! Your dad gave me enough money to buy candy too!

- **Junior**: Thank you, Zari. This is a great date!
- **Zari**: Junior, this is not a date.

### Sentence

On a date, two people want to know each other more and they want to **establish a deeper relationship**.

**“Not talking.”**
✔️ 虽然语法没错，用于口语没问题，但更完整自然的说法是：
✅ _“But no talking.”_

## Writing

### Junior wants to go on a date. Describe your ideal date.

On a date, I want to go out with someone I really like. If two ~~person~~ both love each other, and they do anything to spend time together, I can call that's a date.

- “two person” → should be **“two people”**.
- “they do anything to spend time together” → clearer as **“they're willing to do anything to spend time together.”**
- “I can call that’s a date” → should be **“I would call that a date.”**

On a date, I want to go out with someone I really like. If two people love each other and are willing to do anything to spend time together, I would call that a date.

---

On a date, I want to spend some peaceful time. It could **be going to** **the movies**, restaurants, or even sports. Normal **activities** are OK, but it should be with the right person.

- “It could **be going to** the movies…” → 表达不自然，应改为 “It could **be** going to the movies” 或更好地重构为 “We could go to…”
- “Normal **activities** are OK” → 表达略显生硬，可更自然地说 “Simple activities are fine”
- “but it should be with the right person.” → 语法上没错，但风格可更柔和，例如 “as long as it’s with the right person.”

On a date, **I’d like** to spend some **peaceful, relaxing time**. **We could** go to the movies, **have a nice meal** at a restaurant, or even do something fun like a casual sport. The activity itself doesn’t matter that much — what’s more important is being with the right person.

约会时我希望能有一段平静、轻松的时光。我们可以去看电影、在餐厅吃顿饭，或者做点轻松有趣的运动。活动本身不是最重要的，关键是和对的人在一起。

On a date, I want to go with someone we love each other. Not as Junior, only he likes the other people. We can do anything for **relaxation**.

- **“go with someone we love each other”** → 结构错误。“we love each other” 是一个完整句，不能直接接在 “someone” 后面。 ✅ 可改为：**“someone I love and who loves me too”**
- **“Not as Junior, only he likes the other people.”** → 表达不清晰且语法不通。应该明确 Junior 的情况，并用完整句。 ✅ 可改为：**“Not like Junior, where only he likes the other person.”**
- **“do anything for relaxation”** → 虽然可理解，但不够自然。更地道的表达：**“do something relaxing together”**

My ideal date would be with someone I love and who loves me too. Not like Junior, where only he likes the other person. We don’t need to do anything fancy—just something relaxing and fun, like going for a walk, talking, or enjoying a meal together.

我理想的约会是和一个我爱、也爱我的人一起。不是像 Junior 那样，只有他单方面喜欢对方。我们不需要做什么特别的事情，只要一起放松、开心就好，比如散步、聊天，或者一起吃顿饭。

贴近原始故事

My ideal date would be with someone who **likes me as much as I like them**—unlike Junior, who thought he was on a date with someone who was just his babysitter. A real date should be special for both people. We could go to a nice restaurant, talk, laugh, and enjoy each other's company. It’s not just about spending time together—it’s about **sharing a real connection**.

我理想的约会应该是和一个彼此喜欢的人一起——不像 Junior，那只是他一个人的“约会”，对方其实只是他的保姆。真正的约会应该是双方都觉得特别的时刻。我们可以一起去一家不错的餐厅，聊天、笑、享受彼此的陪伴。不只是一起待着而已，更重要的是两个人之间的真实连接。

My ideal date would be with someone who **likes me as much as I like them**

My ideal date would be with someone who likes me as much as I like him.

为什么用 **“them”** 来指代 “someone”？（即使是一个人）

英语中的一种叫做 **“singular they”**（单数 they）的用法。

这里的 **“them”** 是用来指代前面那个 **“someone”**，虽然 **“someone” 是单数**，但因为性别不明确（could be he or she），英语中常用 **“they/them”** 来避免性别偏向。

_If someone calls, tell **them** I’m not home._
（如果有人打电话，就告诉**他/她**我不在。）

_Everyone should bring **their** own lunch._
（每个人都应该带**他/她**自己的午餐。）

### **Describe your ideal date**

_You should say:_
– where you would like to go
– what you would like to do
– who you would like to be with
and explain why this would be your ideal date

---

#### **Sample Answer:**

My ideal date would be simple but meaningful. I’m not really into overly fancy or complicated plans — for me, it’s more about the feeling and the connection than the activity itself.

I’d love to start with something relaxing, like going to **a cozy café** or a quiet restaurant where we can talk without distractions. After that, maybe we could take a walk in a park, by the river, or even around the city at night. I enjoy peaceful environments, especially when I’m with someone I like, because it gives us a chance to have real conversations and just enjoy each other’s company.

The person I’d want to be with is someone I feel comfortable around — someone who can make me laugh, who listens, and who doesn’t pretend to be someone they’re not. I think the right person can turn even the simplest moments into something unforgettable.

So overall, my ideal date isn’t about doing something **extravagant** — it’s about being with the right person, **having quality time**, and feeling completely at ease.

我理想中的约会其实很简单，但有意义。我不太喜欢那种太浮夸或复杂的安排，对我来说，约会更重要的是那种感觉和彼此的连接，而不是具体做了什么。

我希望从轻松的事情开始，比如去一家温馨的咖啡馆或安静的餐厅，这样我们可以专心聊天，不被打扰。之后可能可以去散步——不管是在公园、河边，还是夜晚的城市街头。我很喜欢这种平静的环境，特别是和一个我喜欢的人一起，可以好好聊天、享受彼此的陪伴。

我希望和那个人相处起来很舒服，他能让我笑，愿意倾听，也不会伪装自己。我觉得对的人可以把最简单的瞬间，变得特别而难忘。

所以对我来说，理想的约会不是做多豪华的事，而是和对的人共度一段舒服、真诚的时光。

### **Describe your ideal date**

_You should say:_
– where you would go
– what you would do
– who you would be with
and explain why this would be your ideal date

---

#### **Sample Answer:**

My ideal date would be something simple and peaceful — nothing too fancy or stressful. I think the best dates aren’t about spending a lot of money or going somewhere extravagant, but about enjoying quality time together in a comfortable setting.

We could go to a quiet café or a cozy restaurant where we can talk without too much noise. Maybe after that, we could go for a walk, or even watch a movie together if we’re in the mood. I’m also open to something active, like going to a park or playing a casual sport, as long as we’re both having fun.

The activity itself isn’t that important to me — what matters most is being with someone I really connect with. If I feel relaxed, respected, and understood, then even the simplest plan becomes meaningful. So for me, the perfect date is less about what we do, and more about **who I’m with**.

我理想的约会其实很简单、安静，不需要太花哨或紧张。我认为最好的约会并不是花很多钱或去很高级的地方，而是在一个舒服的环境中度过高质量的时间。

我们可以去一个安静的咖啡馆或者温馨的餐厅，能好好聊天就很好了。之后也许可以散步，或者如果有心情，也可以一起看电影。如果两个人都喜欢，也可以去公园或做些轻松的运动。

对我来说，活动本身并不是最重要的。真正关键的是和我在一起的人。如果我觉得放松、被尊重和理解，那么再简单的安排都会变得很有意义。所以我觉得完美的约会，更重要的是“人”，而不是“做什么”。

I think the best dates aren’t about spending a lot of money or going somewhere extravagant, but about enjoying quality time together **in a comfortable setting**.

“comfortable setting” 的意思：这个短语里的 **“setting”** 指的是 **环境 / 场景 / 氛围**，
而 **“comfortable”** 则表示 **令人放松、自在、不紧张的**。

"a comfortable setting" 就可以理解为：一个让人觉得放松、不拘束、可以自然交谈的环境。

| comfortable setting 可能是... | 为什么它是 comfortable       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 一家安静的咖啡馆 ☕️          | 灯光柔和，可以轻松说话，不吵 |
| 河边或公园散步 🚶‍♂️             | 空气清新，节奏慢，氛围放松   |
| 朋友家小聚 🍲                 | 不需要拘谨，熟人环境         |
| 小酒馆、书店、露天座位 🍷📚   | 有个性但不压迫，气氛温和     |
