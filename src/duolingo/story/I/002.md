# I Can Fix It!

Oscar is standing outside his classroom. He looks upset. Another teacher, Eddy, walks by.

- **Eddy**: Hi, Oscar! Is everything OK?
- **Oscar**: No. I called someone to fix the bathroom sink **in** my house, but he's very late. (~~at~~)
- **Eddy**: You have a problem with your bathroom sink? I can fix it!
- **Oscar**: No, thanks. I want to call a professional.
- **Eddy**: I fix things in my house all the time! Come on, you'll save money!
- **Oscar**: Hmm... I can save some money?

After school, Oscar and Eddy go to Oscar's house.

- **Eddy**: Your house is so fancy.
  - It should be in a magazine!
- **Oscar**: Thank you. It was in a magazine last year.
- **Eddy**: I love your gold bathroom mirror! And your towels are so white!
- **Oscar**: Yes, and very expensive.
- **Eddy**: Wow, this vase is nice too! Putting flowers on top of the toilet is a great idea.
- **Oscar**: Eddy, are you going to fix the sink?
- **Eddy**: Oh! Yes, of course.

Eddy walks towards the sink. He accident**a**lly hits the vase. It falls on the floor and breaks.

- **Eddy**: Oh no! Sorry...
- **Oscar**: It's OK. Just fix the sink, please.

Eddy starts to fix the sink. Water spills on the floor. Eddy grabs a towel.

- **Oscar**: No! Eddy!
  - Don't use my expensive towels!

Eddy stands up quickly and hits the mirror. It falls off the wall and breaks.

- **Eddy**: Oops.
- **Oscar**: My new mirror.
- **Eddy**: OK... I'm finished. Look! I fixed the sink!
- **Oscar**: Thanks. But you broke my vase and my mirror. My towels are dirty. And there's water everywhere!
- **Eddy**: But you didn't have to pay to fix your sink!

#### Have you ever had to fix a problem in your home? Explain your answer.

Yes, I had to fix my sink too. The sink was clogged, I try to put some chemicals to make it unclogged, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. For one time, it didn't work, then I tried more chemical, it took me several days to make it finally unclogged.

> 1. **“Yes, I had to fix my sink too.”** → “too” is unclear; unless responding to someone else, omit it. Use **“before”** instead of “too”.
> 2. **“I try to put some chemicals”** → 时态错误，应为 **“I tried using some chemicals”**
> 3. **“to make it unclogged”** → 语法不自然，改为 **“to clear it”** 或 **“to unclog it”**
> 4. **“For one time”** → 改为 **“One time”**
> 5. **“then I tried more chemical”** → 应为 **“more chemicals”**（不可数/复数）
> 6. **“to make it finally unclogged”** → 应为 **“finally managed to unclog it”**

Yes, I’ve had to fix my sink **before**. It was clogged, **and** I tried using some chemicals to **clear** it. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn’t. One time, it didn’t work at all, so I added more chemicals. It took me several days, but I finally managed to unclog it.

是的，我以前确实需要修理过水槽。水槽堵了，我尝试用一些化学剂疏通。有时候管用，有时候不行。有一次完全没效果，我又加了更多化学剂，花了好几天才终于把它疏通。

Yes, I’ve had to repair a drain before. At the time, I was living in an apartment where the **drainage system** would get clogged from time to time. My washing machine didn’t have a **proper filter**, so after each wash, a lot of debris — including hair — would go straight into the drain. This made it very easy for the pipes to get blocked.

To prevent this, I often used chemical drain cleaners to keep the pipes clear. However, one time the clog was particularly severe. I first tried to clear it using a pressure-based tool, but the pipe had a U-shaped section connected to both the washing machine and the bathroom sink, so I couldn’t create a sealed pressure system.

As a result, I had no choice but to use chemical cleaner. At first, I didn’t use enough, so it didn’t work. Then I used too much, which caused the chemicals to crystallize inside the pipe. It ended up taking me several days to slowly dissolve the blockage and fully unclog the drain.

是的，我曾经修理过下水管道。当时我住在一间公寓中，下水管道时不时会堵。我的洗衣机没有过滤功能，所以洗衣服后的杂质——包括一些头发——都直接流入下水道中，这非常容易导致管道堵塞。

为了预防这种情况，我经常使用化学管道清洁剂来清理管道。不过有一次堵得特别严重。我一开始尝试用带气压的工具来通管道，但那段管道是 U 形的，一头连着洗衣机，一头连着洗脸盆，所以无法形成密闭的压力环境。

结果我只能用化学清洁剂来处理。一开始剂量不够，没有疏通成功，后来用得太多，导致清洁剂在管道里结晶了。最后我花了好几天才慢慢把堵塞物溶解并完全疏通管道。
