# I'm Driving

Bea is waiting for Lin in front of her apartment building.

Lin arrives at the apartment on a motorcycle.

- **Lin**: Are you ready to go to the beach?
- **Bea**: What is that?
- **Lin**: It's my motorcycle!
- **Bea**: I thought that you were going to rent a car.
- **Lin**: Renting a car is very expensive, but riding my motorcycle is free.
  - Now get on.
- **Bea**: You want me to **ride on the back** of your motorcycle?
- **Lin**: What's wrong? Are you scared?
- **Bea**: I'm not scared of anything.
  - Except for **hairless** cats.
- **Lin**: If you're not scared, then let's go.
- **Bea**: OK, but I'm driving.
- **Lin**: You want to drive my motorcycle?
- **Bea**: Of course.
- **Lin**: Bea! Why do you always have to control everything?
  - Why can't you relax?
- **Bea**: I will relax… when you let me drive.
  - Lin, do you want to go to the beach or not?
- **Lin**: Yes, I do.

Later, Bea is driving the motorcycle, and Lin is **riding behind** her.

Lin looks very unhappy.

- **Bea**: You were right. This is better than renting a car.
- **Lin**: And you were right, riding back here is not fun.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Who do you think will drive the motorcycle back? Why?**

I think Bea will probably be **the one** to drive the motorcycle, even if it **leads to** an argument. She **tends to** take charge in every situation, and I don’t think she’ll let anyone else take the lead.

我觉得很可能是 Bea 来骑摩托车回去，即使这会引发争执。她在任何事情上都喜欢掌控局面，我不认为她会让别人来主导。

### Practice History

**Who do you think will drive the motorcycle back? Why?**

> Corrections:

1. **“though they may have an argument”** 放在句中较突兀，建议加逗号做逻辑停顿。
2. **句尾逻辑清晰，但重复用 “But” 显得多余**，应去掉第一个句子中的 **“But”**，或直接连接更流畅。

I think Bea will drive the motorcycle, **though** they may have an argument. Bea is always the one who wants to control everything.

我认为 Bea 会骑摩托车回来，尽管他们可能会争论。但 Bea 总是那个想掌控一切的人。

#### 更正式、适合写作的版本如下：

I believe Bea will drive the motorcycle back. Although she and Lin might argue about it, Bea is the type of person who always wants to be in control. In the end, she insists on driving and even convinces Lin to sit behind her, showing that she tends to take charge in any situation.

我认为 Bea 会骑摩托车回去。虽然她和 Lin 可能会因此争论，但 Bea 是那种总想掌控一切的人。最后，她坚持要自己开车，甚至说服 Lin 坐在后座，这也表明她在任何情况下都喜欢掌握主导权。

In my opinion, Bea is the one who will most likely drive the motorcycle back. Although there might be some disagreement between her and the others, Bea consistently shows a desire to be in control of situations. Her strong personality and tendency to take charge suggest that she would insist on driving, even if it leads to a brief argument.

在我看来，Bea 很可能是那个会骑摩托车回去的人。虽然她和别人之间可能会有一些分歧，但她一贯表现出对掌控局势的强烈欲望。她的强势性格和主导倾向表明，她很可能坚持要自己骑车，即使这会引发一场小争执。
