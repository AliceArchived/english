# I Saw You

**Lily is working in a clothes store.**

**She stops a well-dressed woman leaving the store.**

- **Lily**: Ma'am, did you just put that sweater in your purse?
- **Woman**: My purse? No.
- **Lily**: Yes, you did. I saw you.
- **Woman**: Oh, this sweater?
  - I was going to pay for it, but I forgot. I'm old. My memory is bad.
- **Lily**: Wait, is that a scarf in your purse too?
- **Woman**: Oops!
- **Lily**: Can you please take everything out of your purse?

**The woman takes a scarf, a belt, and a watch out of the purse.**

- **Lily**: Were you trying to steal all of these things?!
- **Woman**: Yes, I was! I love stealing! It's exciting!
  - I live alone. I get bored. One day, you'll understand.
  - I can leave, right? I'm a nice old woman.
- **Lily**: Are you nice?
- **Woman**: Not really. But you could let me leave because you're a nice young woman.
- **Lily**: OK. You can leave. But don't tell anyone that I'm nice.
- **Woman**: OK! Thanks! Goodbye!

**The old woman takes her purse and leaves.**

**Lily's boss runs into the store.**

- **Boss**: Did you let that woman leave?
- **Lily**: Of course I did. Why not?
- **Boss**: She just stole a $300 purse!
