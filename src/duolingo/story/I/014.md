# Impressing Lily - B2

Zari is babysitting Junior at Pirate Land, an amusement park, and she brought her friend Lily. Zari and Junior watch as Lily gets in line to ride an enormous **roller coaster** with **multiple loops**.

- **Junior**: Lily is so cool ... How can I get her to notice me?
- **Zari**: If you want to impress Lily, you should ride **the Death Express** with her. It's Lily's favorite **roller coaster**.
- **Junior**: Of course I want to impress her ... But I don't want to die today!
- **Zari**: Well, if you don't ride it with her, she'll make me do it. Do you want your favorite babysitter to die?

Lily turns around and **calls out to** Junior and Zari.

- **Lily**: Who's riding this roller coaster with me?
- **Junior**: Uhh ... Me?
- **Zari**: Wow, Junior. That's pretty brave for a little kid.
- **Junior**: Yes, it is.

Junior gets in line with Lily. He waves at a park employee to get his attention.

- **Junior**: Please help me. I'm in love with that girl, and I agreed to go on this ride to impress her. But honestly, I'm terrified. Can you tell her I'm too short to ride this roller coaster?
- **Employee**: Sure, kid. Whatever.

The park employee approaches Lily.

- **Employee**: Uh ... sorry, this kid is too short. In order to ride the Death Express, he needs to be at least an inch taller. We don't want any more injuries ... or lawsuits.
- **Lily**: Here, Junior, you can wear my **platform boots**. Then you'll be tall enough.
- **Junior**: Oh. Great ...

Junior reluctantly puts Lily's boots on, which make him an inch taller. He tries to walk forward, but he falls down.

- **Lily**: Perfect. Let's go.

A few minutes later, Junior and Lily get off the Death Express. Junior is **sweaty** and **pale**. He can't walk **in a straight line**.

- **Lily**: Well, Junior, you really impressed me.
- **Junior**: I did?
- **Lily**: Yes, I've never heard anyone scream so loudly.

## Writing

### How do you think Lily feels about Junior after riding the roller coaster? Why?

I believe that Lily probably ~~think~~ Junior is ~~lack of brave~~, ~~easy to be scared~~ and annoying because he screamed so loudly.

> Corrections:

1. “**Lily probably think**”
   - → 主谓不一致，应为 **“Lily probably thinks”**。
2. “**is lack of brave**”
   - → 错误表达，正确为 **“lacks courage”** 或 **“is not very brave”**。
3. “**easy to be scared**” → 不自然，建议改为 **“easily scared”** 或 **“gets scared easily”**。
4. “**and annoying**” 放在句尾有些突兀，建议重组句式让逻辑更自然。

I believe that Lily probably thinks Junior is **not very brave**, **gets scared easily**, and **can be a little annoying** because he screamed so loudly during the ride.

我认为莉莉可能觉得小家伙不太勇敢、很容易被吓到，而且有点烦人，因为他在过山车上尖叫得太大声了。

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0–7.5

I think Lily probably sees Junior **as someone who** isn't very brave and gets scared easily. During the roller coaster ride, he screamed so loudly that it might have seemed a bit annoying to her. She might have expected him to stay calm or at least try to enjoy the ride. So, after the experience, she may feel that Junior is not really the kind of person who enjoys thrills or challenges.

我觉得莉莉可能认为小家伙不太勇敢，也很容易被吓到。在坐过山车的时候，他尖叫得特别大声，可能让莉莉觉得有点烦人。她或许原本希望他能冷静点，或者至少试着享受一下刺激。所以在这次经历之后，她可能会觉得小家伙不是那种喜欢冒险或挑战的人。

I believe that Lily ~~get~~ a worse impression ~~about~~ Junior after riding the roller coaster. Junior screamed too ~~loud~~ when he was riding it.

> Corrections:

1. “Lily **get** a worse impression” 应为
   - “Lily **got** a worse impression”，用过去时态。
2. “too loud” 建议更自然地表达为
   - “screamed **too loudly**”。副词修饰动词。

I believe that Lily **got** a worse impression **of** Junior after riding the roller coaster. Junior screamed **too loudly** during the ride, which **probably embarrassed Lily** or made her feel uncomfortable.

我认为莉莉在坐完过山车后，对小家伙的印象变差了。小家伙在坐的时候叫得太大声了，可能让莉莉觉得尴尬或不舒服。

- have/get an impression **of** someone/something
- have/get a good/bad/worse impression **of** someone

an impression **of**，因为我们说的是**对某人/某物的印象**，不是“关于”的意思（“about” 用于谈论话题，不适合形容印象）。

**[Rewritten Answer]**

I think Lily is a cool and confident girl, so she probably wasn’t impressed by Junior’s loud screaming. Instead, she might have found it amusing or even silly. Her reaction shows that she didn’t take it too seriously—she just teased him in **a lighthearted way**. Lily seems like someone who enjoys the thrill, not the drama.

我认为 Lily 是一个酷而自信的女孩，所以她可能不会因为 Junior 大声尖叫而感到印象深刻。相反，她可能觉得这很搞笑，甚至有点滑稽。她的反应说明她并没有把这事当回事，只是轻松地调侃了他。Lily 看起来更像是那种享受刺激、而不是情绪化的人。
