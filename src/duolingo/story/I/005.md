# I Need to Practice

It's late at night. Eddy wakes up because Junior is loudly playing the drums.

Eddy walks into Junior's room.

- **Eddy**: Junior, it's ten p.m.! Do you have to play the drums now?
- **Junior**: But you said that I won't be a good drummer if I don't practice.
- **Eddy**: I know, but you can't play the drums at night. We both need to sleep!
- **Junior**: Sorry, Dad.

Early the next morning, the sound of drums wakes Eddy up again.

- **Eddy**: Junior, why are you playing now?
- **Junior**: You said not to practice at night, but now it's morning!
- **Eddy**: It's five a.m.!
- **Junior**: I'm sorry, Dad. But I really need to practice.
- **Eddy**: I know you do, son, but not while I'm sleeping.

The next day, Eddy is working in the living room. Junior starts playing the drums again.

- **Eddy**: Junior!
- **Junior**: What's wrong?
- **Eddy**: Do you have to play drums all the time?
- **Junior**: But you're not sleeping now.
- **Eddy**: No, but I'm working, and I can't concentrate when you're playing.
- **Junior**: But I have to practice for my concert!
- **Eddy**: OK, fine…

A few days later, Eddy is at Junior's concert, and he's falling asleep.

Another dad **taps** Eddy on the shoulder.

- **Dad**: Hey! Are you OK?
- **Eddy**: Yeah, I'm just tired. I haven't been sleeping well.
- **Dad**: Well, you have to watch this kid play the drums! He's amazing.

On the stage, Junior is playing a drum solo.

- **Eddy**: Hey! That's my son!
- **Dad**: Really? He's great.
- **Eddy**: Um, yeah, I know! I make him practice all the time!

## Writing

### When should Junior practice the drums? Why?

In my opinion, Junior ~~practice~~ the drums during the day is OK. It may affect Eddy, but during the day, it's easy to find other places to do work.

In my opinion, Junior practicing the drums during the day is OK. It may affect Eddy, but during the day, it's easy to find other places to do work.

> - "Junior practicing the drums during the day is OK." → 语法不够自然，建议改为 "it's okay for Junior to practice the drums during the day."
> - “It may affect Eddy” 可以更清楚地表达为 “It might disturb Eddy.”
> - “do work” 用法略显笨重，更自然的是 “get work done”。

In my opinion, **it's okay for** Junior to practice the drums **during** the day. It **might disturb** Eddy, but during the **daytime**, it's easier to find other places to **get work done**.

I think it's fine for Junior to practice the drums during the day. Even if it bothers Eddy a little, at least he's not trying to sleep. It's much better than waking up to drums at 5 a.m.! During the day, Eddy can always move to another room if he really needs quiet.

我觉得 Junior 白天练鼓是可以的。就算有点打扰 Eddy，起码他不是在睡觉。总比早上五点被鼓声吵醒强吧！白天的话，如果 Eddy 真需要安静，他也可以换个房间。

I think Junior should practice the drums in the afternoon. That way, he won’t wake up Eddy early in the morning or disturb him while he’s working. It’s a good time for both of them.

我认为 Junior 应该在下午练鼓。这样他既不会一大早吵醒 Eddy，也不会在 Eddy 工作时打扰他。这个时间对他们俩都合适。
