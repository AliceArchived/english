# I'm the Manager

Lily arrives at the clothing store where she works. Her boss immediately comes to talk to her.

- **Boss**: Lily, you're late again.
- **Lily**: I know.
- **Boss**: We need to have a serious **conversation**.
- **Lily**: Alright.
- **Boss**: There's always a mess in the store when you're working.
- **Lily**: If I clean the store, the customers make it messy again, so I just wait until the end of the day to clean.
- **Boss**: But you never clean the store at the end of the day.
- **Lily**: That's true.
- **Boss**: And the music you play is too loud.
- **Lily**: I play loud music so the customers can't talk to me.
- **Boss**: That's another thing. You are so mean to the customers!

A customer walks over to Lily.

- **Customer**: Excuse me, do you have this shirt in a different color?
- **Lily**: No, go away.
- **Customer**: Haha, you're so funny. Bye!

- **Boss**: That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- **Lily**: So ... am I going to lose my job?
- **Boss**: No. Unfortunately, you're the best employee that I have. **I'm giving** you a promotion.
- **Lily**: Really?
- **Boss**: I don't know why, but all our customers love you.
  - They think you're cool, and they love loud music. And then they spend a lot of money here.
- **Lily**: That's really funny.
- **Boss**: So, starting today, you're going to be a manager.
  - You'll have to make the work schedule for all the employees.
- **Lily**: Ew.
- **Boss**: But you will make more money.
- **Lily**: That's cool.
- **Boss**: And you need to be the first person here every morning.
- **Lily**: I'm not going to do that.
- **Boss**: I know.
- **Lily**: Thanks for the promotion. Bye.
- **Boss**: Wait, you just got here! Where are you going?
- **Lily**: I decided I'm not working today. I'm the manager now.

## Writing

### Do you think Lily will be a good manager? Why?

No, I don't think she will be a good manager. She doesn't like her job and **isn't** willing to take more responsibility.

---

No, I don't think Lily will be a good manager. She is not responsible ~~to~~ her work, so I don't think she can really manage well.

- “responsible to her work” → 用法错误，正确应为 “responsible **for** her work”
- “she can really manage well” → 表达笼统，可更具体

No, I don’t think Lily will be a good manager. She isn’t responsible **for** her work, and **she doesn’t seem to take her tasks seriously**. A good manager needs to lead by example and **be committed**, but Lily lacks both responsibility and motivation.

不，我不认为 Lily 会是一个好经理。她对工作不负责任，也不太认真对待自己的任务。一个好的经理需要以身作则，并且要有投入感，但 Lily 缺乏责任心和动力。

No, I don't think Lily will be a good manager. Because she **cannot** do things well. She got **promoted** because of customers' love, not her excellent job. How can she make other people do things well? Also, she doesn't **focus** on doing **the** job well.

- “Because she **cannot** do things well.” 是**片段句**（fragment），应该合并到前一句或重写。
- “make other people do things well” 表达不够清晰自然，建议改为 “lead others to perform well”。
- “focus on doing **the** job well” 中的 “the” 可以保留，也可以删去；但前面整句结构略显重复。

No, I don't think Lily will be a good manager **because** she **doesn't** do **her job** well. She **was promoted** because customers **liked** her, **not because of** her excellent **performance**. If she can't **manage** her own work **effectively**, how can she **lead** others to **perform** well? Also, she doesn't seem to focus on doing the job **properly**.

不，我不认为 Lily 会是个好经理，因为她自己工作就做得不好。她是因为客户喜欢她才被提拔的，而不是因为表现出色。如果她连自己的工作都管理不好，又怎么能带领别人做好工作呢？而且她似乎也不专注于把工作做好。

**[Rewritten Answer]**
I don’t think Lily will be a good manager. She doesn’t take her job seriously—she arrives late, doesn’t clean the store, and plays loud music just to avoid talking to customers. Even though customers seem to like her attitude, she clearly isn’t interested in responsibility. In fact, as soon as she got promoted, she decided not to work that day!

我认为莉莉不会是一个好经理。她对工作不够认真——她经常迟到、不打扫店面，还故意放很吵的音乐来避免和顾客交流。虽然顾客似乎喜欢她的态度，但她显然不愿意承担责任。事实上，她一被升职就决定当天不工作了！
