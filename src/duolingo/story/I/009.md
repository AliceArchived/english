# I Want the Sandwich

**Vikram and Oscar sit down in a restaurant.**

- **Oscar**: I love this place. I always order the **grilled** cheese sandwich.
- **Vikram**: Me too.

**A waiter comes to their table.**

- **Waiter**: Are you ready to order?
- **Vikram**: Two grilled cheese sandwiches, please.
- **Waiter**: Sorry. We only have one more grilled cheese sandwich.
- **Oscar**: OK, then I'll have it.
- **Vikram**: Wait. Why do you **get** the sandwich?
  - Could you give us a minute?

**The waiter walks away.**

- **Oscar**: I want the sandwich, Vikram.
- **Vikram**: No, I want the sandwich.
- **Oscar**: But it was my idea to come here!
- **Vikram**: I helped you paint your apartment last week.
  - And then you borrowed my car.
- **Oscar**: I borrowed your car to take you to the hospital!
- **Vikram**: Because I **fell out of** your window while I was painting!
  - And then I gave you my chocolate cake at the hospital.
- **Oscar**: That was a delicious chocolate cake.
  - OK, you can have the sandwich.

The waiter returns.

- **Oscar**: My friend, Vikram, will have the sandwich.
- **Waiter**: While you were talking, someone ordered the last sandwich.
- **Vikram**: I hate this restaurant!
- **Oscar**: Yeah, I told you we shouldn't eat here.
