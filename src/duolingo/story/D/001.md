# Dating Apps

Eddy and his neighbor, Bea, are watching a movie.

- **Eddy**: Ahhh… I want my life to be like **a romantic comedy**.
- **Bea**: So, you want a woman to fall in love with you after you spill coffee on her? That's not realistic.
- **Eddy**: Yeah, you're right. I'm going to be alone forever!
- **Bea**: Come on, Eddy, that's not true!
  - Have you tried a dating app?
- **Eddy**: They don't work for me. I always forget my password.
- **Bea**: Eddy, how are you this bad **with** technology!?

Bea grabs Eddy's phone.

- **Bea**: Here. I set up a profile on the dating app for you. Your password is "password".
- **Eddy**: Why did you write that I like sports, romantic comedies, and spending time with my son?
- **Bea**: Because it's true!
- **Eddy**: I sound like a boring person.

Just then, Eddy's phone beeps.

- **Eddy**: I have a match already!

Eddy's phone beeps twelve more times.

- **Bea**: Whoa! You have a lot of matches.

The next morning, Bea comes over to Eddy's apartment.

- **Bea**: Good morning, neighbor! I brought you coffee!

Eddy says nothing. He is quickly typing on his phone.

- **Bea**: Are you talking to one of your matches on the app?
- **Eddy**: Yes… well, I'm talking to… a few of them.
- **Bea**: Wait, are you wearing the same clothes **from** yesterday? You look exhausted!
- **Eddy**: I've been awake all night!
- **Bea**: What? Why?
- **Eddy**: This dating app! Women keep messaging me!

Bea looks at Eddy's phone.

- **Bea**: Wait, you're messaging ninety-eight women? Did you accept every request? You have to say no to some of them!
- **Eddy**: But any one of these women could be my soulmate. And… I wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

Bea takes Eddy's phone away.

- **Bea**: You're too nice for dating apps, Eddy.

**What do you think of dating apps? Why?**

In my view, dating apps aren’t that reliable **these days**. Back when the internet was **still new**, some people were genuinely able to find true love online — in fact, a few of my friends actually met their life partners through dating apps. But over time, things have changed. There are more and more online **scams** and **dishonest** people now, and sadly, many of these scams are carefully planned. That’s why I believe it’s really important to be **extra cautious** when using dating apps nowadays.

在我看来，现在的交友软件并不那么可靠。互联网刚兴起的时候，有些人确实能在网上找到真爱——实际上，我有几位朋友就是通过交友软件遇到了他们的伴侣。但随着时间的推移，情况已经变了。现在网上的骗局和不诚实的人越来越多，而且很多骗局都是精心策划的。这也是为什么我认为现在用交友软件时必须格外小心。

In my opinion, dating apps aren’t very **reliable** these days. There are **just too many scams** on these platforms. We can also see that **quite a few** employees from dating app companies have left their jobs to work as **matchmakers** on **live streaming platforms**. This shows that people still want to find a partner, but they don’t rely on dating apps as much as they used to.

在我看来，现在的交友软件并不是很可靠。这些平台上实在有太多骗局了。我们也看到，不少交友软件公司的员工辞职去做直播平台的红娘。这说明人们依然希望找到伴侣，但他们不像以前那样依赖交友软件了。

### 🌟 Speaking Band 8.0

In my opinion, dating apps have become an increasingly unreliable **avenue** for **forming** meaningful relationships. A growing number of online scams and **deceptive** behaviors have made users more **wary** and distrustful. **Interestingly**, many former employees of dating app companies have reportedly **transitioned** into matchmaking roles on live-streaming platforms. This shift indicates that while people remain interested in romantic connections, they are turning to more personalized and trustworthy alternatives, likely motivated by safety concerns and a desire for genuine, human-centered experiences.

在我看来，交友应用越来越不可靠，难以建立真正有意义的关系。网上诈骗和欺骗行为日益增多，使用户更加警惕与不信任。有趣的是，据报道，许多交友应用公司的前员工已经转型为直播平台上的红娘。这种转变表明，尽管人们仍然渴望建立浪漫关系，但他们正转向更加个性化和可信赖的替代方案，背后的原因很可能是安全方面的担忧和对真实、人性化互动的追求。

Bea 抢走了 Eddy 的手机，因为他同时在给九十八个女人发信息，而且对她们谁都不懂得拒绝。

> Corrections:

1. **“There are too many cheating scams”**
   - → 正确，不过也可以简化为 “too many scams” 表达更自然
2. **“to matchmake for live streams”**
   - → 更自然的说法是 **“to become matchmakers on live streams”** 或 **“to do matchmaking through live streams”**
3. 最后一部分 **“as much”** 可补上 **“anymore”**，使句子更完整

In my opinion, dating apps are not **reliable** nowadays. There are too many scams on dating apps. We can also see that many employees from dating app companies have quit their jobs to become **matchmakers** for **live streams**. This shows that people still want to date, but they don’t use dating apps as much anymore.

In my opinion, dating apps are not **reliable** nowadays. At first, when **the** internet was a new **thing**, people **could** find their true **love** online, and a few of my friends really found their spouses online. Later, more and more **cheating** online, and I should say a lot of them are **planned**.

> Corrections:

1. "the internet was a new thing" 语法没错，但可以更自然地表达
2. “cheating online”
   - → 用法模糊，建议改为 “**online scams**” 或 “**dishonest behavior online**”
3. “a lot of them are planned”
   - → 语义不清晰，应改为 “many of these scams are well-planned” 更具体准确

In my opinion, dating apps are not **very reliable nowadays**. When **the** internet **first** became **popular**, people **could** find their true love online, and a few of my friends actually **met** their spouses **that way**. But later, there were more and more online **scams**, and **I have to say**, many of them are **carefully planned**.

在我看来，现在的交友软件并不太可靠。刚开始互联网流行时，人们确实能在网上找到真爱，我的一些朋友的确通过这种方式找到了伴侣。但后来，网上的诈骗越来越多，而且很多都是精心策划的。

### Balanced Answer — Pros & Cons of Dating Apps

Well, I think dating apps have both advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, they provide an easy and convenient way for people to meet, especially for those who are too busy to socialize in real life. You can connect with people from different backgrounds and locations, which might not happen in your daily routine. I actually know a few people who found long-term relationships through dating apps, so it can definitely work.

On the other hand, there are serious risks involved. Online profiles aren’t always honest, and some users have bad intentions. In recent years, there’s been a rise in online scams and emotional manipulation. Some people even create fake identities just to take advantage of others. So I think while dating apps can be useful, users really need to stay cautious and not trust someone too quickly.

In the end, it depends on how you use them. If people treat dating apps as just one way to meet others — and not the only way — they might have a better experience.

### 🌟 Formal Style

In my view, dating apps are no longer a reliable way to **build genuine relationships**. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in online scams and dishonest behavior on these platforms, which makes users more cautious and distrustful. Moreover, it has been reported that many former employees of dating app companies have resigned to become matchmakers on **live-streaming platforms**. This trend suggests that although people are still interested in finding **romantic partners**, they are seeking **alternatives** to traditional dating apps, possibly due to safety concerns and the desire for more **authentic**, human-centered interactions.

在我看来，交友软件已不再是建立真诚关系的可靠方式。近年来，这些平台上的诈骗和虚假行为显著增加，使用户变得更加谨慎和不信任。此外，有报道称，许多交友平台的前员工已辞职，转而在直播平台上担任红娘。这一趋势表明，尽管人们仍希望找到伴侣，但他们正在寻找替代传统交友软件的方式，可能是出于安全考虑，也可能是希望获得更真实、更以人为本的互动。
