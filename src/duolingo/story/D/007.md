# Dress Shopping

Lily is shopping for a pink dress with her mom.

- **Lily**: Do we really have to go to Aunt Betty’s wedding?
- **Mom**: Yes! She’s finally getting married!
- **Lily**: But I hate the color pink … and wearing dresses!
- **Mom**: I know, but everyone **in** the wedding is wearing a black suit or a pink dress.

Lily’s mom shows her a short pink dress.

- **Mom**: How about this one?
- **Lily**: It’s too short!
- **Mom**: OK, what about this one? It’s longer than **the other dress**.
- **Lily**: It has **feathers**! I don’t want to look like a bird.
  - This is stupid! I’m only going to wear this dress **once**.
- **Mom**: But this is really important to Aunt Betty.
- **Lily**: You just want me to look pretty.
- **Mom**: No, I want you to be comfortable. Let’s go to another **store**!
- **Lily**: Mom, wait! You said everyone is wearing a black suit or a pink dress, right?

Lily shows her mom a small black suit.

- **Lily**: You hate it, right?
- **Mom**: Actually, I think it will look great **on** you!
