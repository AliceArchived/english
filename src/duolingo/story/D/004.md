# Dog Walker for Hire - B2

**Attention Dogs And Dog Owners!**

Does your dog have legs? If so, then your dog needs to be walked! Trust your dogs with me, Junior, a trained dog walker with two weeks and three days of experience.

This is what my happy customers have been saying.

Franchesca, client for two weeks:

- **Franchesca**: Junior picked up and threw away my dog's **poop**, which is pretty much all I was looking for.

Sebastian, client since yesterday:

- **Sebastian**: Junior's rates are the lowest I've ever seen, probably because he's a kid.

Winston, a champion **Labrador** (this is what I assume he was thinking)

- **Winston**: Junior's always on time, friendly, and even lets me chase squirrels!

**Intrigued**? Read more about my **exceptional services**...

I'll walk any dogs of any size — as long as they're smaller than me. While I am extremely mature, I still have a very small body because I am eight years old.

I can walk dogs any time of day, except during school hours. My teachers won't let me leave class, even though I've told them that it's for my business **endeavours**. But honestly, dog walking teaches me much more important lessons than I could ever learn at school.

**Inquire** for rates, availability, and to schedule a **consultation** by emailing junior@duomail.co.

I accept **payments** **in** cash, credit, or cryptocurrency (and tips in candy, ice cream, and video games.)

## Writing

### Junior walks dogs! Would you hire him if you had one? Why or why not?

Personally, I would like to hire Junior to walk my dog if I had one. He is a kid, and this is the first time he tries to do a business. As an adult, I am happy to offer him opportunity to try business.

> Corrections:

1. **“this is the first time he tries to do a business”**
   - → Verb tense inconsistency. Should match **conditional mood**.
   - → “do a business” is unnatural. Better: **“start a business”** or **“run a business.”**
2. **“offer him opportunity”**
   - → Missing article: should be **“offer him an opportunity.”**
3. **“try business”**
   - → Unnatural phrasing. Better: **“try running a business”** or **“gain experience with business.”**

Personally, I would like to hire Junior to walk my dog if I **had** one. He’s just a kid, and it **would be** his first time **starting a business**. As an adult, **I’d be** happy to give him **an** opportunity to try something entrepreneurial.

就我个人来说，如果我有一只狗，我会愿意雇 Junior 来遛。毕竟他还只是个孩子，而且这可能是他第一次尝试创业。作为一名成年人，我愿意给他一个机会去尝试这样的经历。

- entrepreneurial: 英 /ˌɒntrəprəˈnɜːriəl/ 美 /ˌɑːntrəprəˈnɜːriəl/
  - adj. 企业家的，创业者的；中间商的

### 🌟 IELTS Band 8 Version:

If I had a dog, I would definitely consider hiring Junior to walk it. Although he's just a kid, he’s clearly **making an effort** to start his first small business, which shows **initiative** and **responsibility**. As an adult, I believe it's important to encourage young people when they **take steps** toward independence, so I’d be happy to give him a chance to gain experience.

如果我有一只狗，我肯定会考虑雇 Junior 来遛狗。虽然他只是个孩子，但他显然在努力开始他的第一个小生意，这展现了主动性和责任感。作为成年人，我认为在年轻人迈出独立的一步时给予鼓励很重要，所以我愿意给他这个获得经验的机会。
