# Dinner with the CEO

Bea is using the photocopier at work. Her boss, Craig, comes to talk to her.

- **Craig**: Bea, **I’m meeting** our company’s CEO for dinner tonight.
  - Can you come? You couldn’t come **last time**.
- **Bea**: I really want to come, but I can’t.
- **Craig**: OK, but she really wants to meet you …
- **Bea**: I know. I’m sorry.

Later, Craig is eating dinner with the CEO, Paula.

Bea walks past their table.

- **Craig**: Bea, you’re here!
- **Bea**: Oh… hi, Craig! You chose … this restaurant?
- **Craig**: I’m so happy that you came to the meeting. This is Paula, our CEO!
- **Bea**: Um … Actually, I’m not here to meet with you.
- **Craig**: What?!
- **Bea**: I work here every night … as a waitress.
- **Paula**: This is the **intern** you wanted me to meet?
- **Craig**: Yes, but I didn’t know …
- **Paula**: I also had two jobs when I was younger!
  - Bea, I can see that you’re a hard worker. I want to hear all your ideas for our company!
- **Bea**: Wow, thanks!
  - But first, I should give you some bread, or my **other boss** will be angry.
