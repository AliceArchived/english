# Dramatic Warning Delivery - B3

A chapter from "Living Like an Artist"

As someone who appreciates the drama of life, I've always thought warnings are best delivered like an opera. A little drama never hurt anyone. Let's look at how to turn a simple warning into the main event.

**Set the stage.**

First, imagine you're on stage at the opera, even if you're just in your kitchen. Use your hands to create **big gestures**, like a conductor. This helps to keep everyone's attention. If you had imagined yourself already as the opera star, you would have warned people more effectively.

**Use your voice.**

Speak loudly and use a deep voice. If I had drunk several cups of warm tea, my voice would've been ready for singing. Your warnings should sound like a dramatic tale. Even if you just want to warn someone not to leave their shoes in the hall, make it sound important!

**Be dramatic.**

Now, for the most crucial part: emotion! If you think about disappointing anyone, let your face show it as if you were in a big performance. If I had gone to acting school, I could have been more convincing. Think of it as a chance **of** put on a show for your "audience."

But turning simple warnings into opera-worth moments, you'll leave a lasting impression. People will always remember your warnings — and your style! After all, who wouldn't want a little more drama in their day?

Now you can live like me!

Congratulations.

  - “of” → “to” — grammar error that also disrupts the fluent, playful tone.
- "But turning simple warnings into opera-worth moments..."
  - Correction: "By turning simple warnings into opera-worthy moments..."
  - “But” → “By”; “opera-worth” → “opera-worthy” — for correct idiom and smoother, more natural phrasing.

  - Add exclamation mark to match the upbeat, theatrical tone of the piece.

**How does Oscar suggest setting the stage ?**

Oscar **recommends** that when people want to deliver a warning effectively, they should act as though they are performing on stage. This means making **bold** and **exaggerated** gestures to capture attention and emphasize the seriousness of the message. Instead of simply speaking the warning in a flat or casual tone, they should **dramatize** it — much like an actor would in a **theatrical** performance. This approach, he believes, helps ensure the message is taken seriously and remembered.

Oscar 建议，当人们想要有效地传达警告时，应该像在舞台上表演一样。他的意思是应该使用大胆而夸张的动作，以吸引注意力并强调信息的重要性。与其平淡或随意地说出警告，不如像演员一样戏剧化地表达。他认为这种方式能让人们更加认真地对待警告内容，也更容易记住它。
