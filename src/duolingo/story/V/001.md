# Vikram's Sick Day

Vikram wakes up in his bed, sweating and confused. His wife, Priti, comes into the room and sits beside him.

- **Vikram**: What time is it?! I should be at the bakery!
- **Priti**: You're too sick to work. I turned off your alarm so you could rest.
- **Vikram**: But I never get sick! I take care of others when they get sick!

Vikram stands up and immediately falls down.

- **Priti**: Vik, you have a fever of 105 degrees.
- **Vikram**: 105 isn't bad! Ovens get much hotter than that.
- **Priti**: No more arguing! You're staying home.
- **Vikram**: Fine.

Later, Priti is making soup in the kitchen. Vikram takes the spoon from her.

- **Vikram**: Go sit down! I'll finish cooking.
- **Priti**: You're not well enough.

Vikram sneezes into the soup.

- **Priti**: Never mind. I'll order takeout.
- **Vikram**: Which one of you is ordering takeout? I'm seeing three of you. And you're all beautiful.
- **Priti**: You're **hallucinating**!

The doorbell rings. Priti goes to answer it and sees their friend, Eddy.

- **Eddy**: Can Vikram make dessert for my date tonight?
- **Priti**: Eddy, Vikram's not your personal chef.

Priti closes the door as Vikram crawls across the floor.

- **Vikram**: Please, Priti. I need to help Eddy!
- **Priti**: Absolutely not. Go to bed!

Later, Priti finds Vikram in the bathroom. He's asleep on the floor, and there's water everywhere.

- **Priti**: The bathroom is flooded!
- **Vikram**: I'd been preparing this relaxing bath with **lavender** oil for you to thank you for taking care of me… but I fell asleep!
- **Priti**: That's it! I'm taking you to bed.

Priti leads Vikram to bed. A few hours later, Vikram wakes up from a nap.

- **Vikram**: I feel much better!
- **Priti**: Good.

Priti sneezes.

- **Priti**: Oh no, I think I have a fever.
- **Vikram**: I'm feeling better, and now you're sick?
  - Wonderful! Now I can finally take care of you!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

Priti closed the door on Eddy because he had asked Vikram to make dessert for his date, but Vikram was too sick to help. I think Priti probably felt it was unreasonable to bother someone who wasn’t feeling well.

Priti 把门关上了，不让 Eddy 进来，因为 Eddy 让 Vikram 给他的约会对象做甜点，但 Vikram 病得太厉害了，没法帮忙。我觉得 Priti 可能觉得在别人身体不舒服的时候去打扰他不太合理。

**Are you like Vikram when you're sick?**

Honestly, I’m not like Vikram at all when I’m sick. He stays **positive** and tries to help others, but when I’m ill, I just feel exhausted and prefer to rest quietly. I really **admire his attitude**, but I don’t have that kind of **energy** when I’m unwell.

说实话，我生病时一点也不像 Vikram。他总是积极乐观，还会试着帮助别人，但我生病时只觉得很累，只想安静地休息。我真的很佩服他的态度，但我不太有那种精力。

### Practice History

**Why did Priti close the door on Eddy?**

Priti closed/ too sick/ make dessert

Priti closed the door on Eddy because Eddy asked Vikram to make dessert for his date, but Vikram is too sick to make dessert.

> Corrections:

1. “is too sick” 时态应该和叙述一致，用过去式 “was too sick”，因为这件事已经发生了。
2. “make dessert” 重复，后一句可以用 “do it” 避免重复，让语气更自然。

Priti closed the door on Eddy because Eddy asked Vikram to make dessert for his date, but Vikram **was** too sick **to do it**.

**Are you like Vikram when you're sick?**

**When I’m sick, I’m not really like Vikram. I usually feel too tired and just want to rest, whereas Vikram seems so positive and energetic. I admire people like him, but I’m definitely not that way when I don’t feel well.**

---

When I'm sick, I **want** someone like Vikram. But I think Vikram is too good to be true. It feels good that there is always someone **taking** care of me, but still, **do those** kinds of **people** exist in reality?

> Corrections:

1. **"do those kinds of people exist"** – grammatically awkward. “Those kinds” is redundant when followed by “people.” Better phrased as **"Do people like that exist?"** or **"Do such people exist?"**

When I'm sick, I **want** someone like Vikram. But I think Vikram is too good to be true. It feels good to have someone always taking care of me — but still, **do such people really exist in real life?**

---

When I'm sick, I **wish I had** someone like Vikram. But **honestly**, he seems too good to be true. It’s **comforting** to imagine someone always taking care of me — but do people like that really exist in the real world?

> Corrections:

1. 为提升自然度，“do people like that really exist in the real world?” 可以改成 “do people like that actually exist?”，语气更自然流畅。

When I’m sick, I **wish I had someone** like Vikram. But honestly, he seems **almost** too good to be true. It’s **comforting** to imagine having someone who’s always there to take care of me — but do people like that **actually exist**?

当我生病时，我真希望身边有一个像 Vikram 这样的人。不过，说实话，他好得几乎让人难以置信。想象有一个人总是在身边照顾自己确实很安心——但现实中真的有这样的人存在吗？
