# Vikram’s Surprise

Priti enters the kitchen. It’s filled with smoke.

- **Priti**: Oh no! What happened in here?
- **Vikram**: I was going to do something special for your birthday.
- **Priti**: Thanks, Vik, but …
- **Vikram**: While I was baking your cake, I lost my wedding ring!
  - Then I realized that it went in the cake!
  - I had to eat the whole cake by myself to find it.
- **Priti**: OK…
- **Vikram**: After I ate the whole cake, I was really tired. So I went to lie down.
- **Priti**: Uh huh …
- **Vikram**: I went to sleep. But I woke up because I smelled smoke.
  - I forgot that I was cooking dinner **in the oven**, and a fire started!
- **Priti**: Oh no.
- **Vikram**: I ran into the kitchen.
  - I put the water from a vase on the fire!
- **Priti**: My hero!
- **Vikram**: But the flowers I bought for you were in that vase, too.

Vikram gives his wife the flowers. They’re ruined.

- **Vikram**: Surprise?
- **Priti**: Oh, sweetie. This isn’t a surprise.
- **Vikram**: It’s not?
- **Priti**: No. You start a fire in the kitchen on my birthday every year.
  - So I got our favorite pizza. Surprise!
