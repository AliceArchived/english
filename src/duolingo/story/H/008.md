# How to Plan a Parade - B3

A chapter for "Living Like an Artist"

There was a big parade every summer in my town. It was the most stylish event of the year. To have a memorable parade, you must follow my advice. I have the best ideas for parades!

**Make a grand entrance.**

In a memorable parade, your entrance should be grand. Imagine a float shaped like a giant brush. As the float moves, the brush "paints" a picture behind it. It's an unforgettable start to the parade.

**Use lots of color.**

For a parade to be memorable, you need a lot of colors. Bright and bold! And remember, if you're going to have balloons, they must be the biggest. No boring colors allowed. Trust me, everyone will remember it.

End with a surprise!

Finally, every parade needs a surprise. Imagine a beautiful firework display at the end. It will make everyone talk about your parade for weeks. They'll wish they could see it again. No wonder people love parades like this!

Remember, a parade is not just about walking in a line. It's an event — a spectacle! People will look forward to it every year if you do it right.

Now you can live like me!

Congratulations.

**What would make Oscar's parade unforgettable?**

I believe Oscar’s idea of a float that paints a picture during the parade is **incredibly creative** and would leave **a lasting impression**. However, I do see **a practical issue**. As the float moves forward and finishes the painting, what happens next? Should it start painting again? If so, different parts of the audience would see different stages — some enjoying **the live creation process**, while others only see **the finished result**. This inconsistency might weaken the overall impact and make the experience less enjoyable for some viewers.

我认为奥斯卡提出的“由花车在游行过程中绘画”的想法非常有创意，肯定能给人留下深刻印象。但我也注意到一个现实问题：当花车完成画作后，接下来要怎么处理？是否应该重新开始画一幅？如果是这样，不同位置的观众就会看到不同的画面——有些人能看到现场创作的过程，而另一些人只能看到已经完成的作品。这种观赏上的不一致可能会削弱整体效果，让一部分观众的体验不够理想。

### Practice History

**What would make Oscar's parade unforgettable?**

Helpful Phrases: I think/ The idea of/ Oscar's advice about

I think the idea of Oscar's advice about a floating brushing painting a picture during a parade would make the parade **unforgettable**, though it could difficult to **do**. Think about a parade through a street, at one end of the street the brush **starts** painting, but when it **finishes**, how **do you** handle it?

> Corrections:

1. "floating brushing painting" is grammatically unclear. It should be clarified to “a float brushing and painting” or "a float with a brush painting" to reflect the parade float concept.
2. "could difficult to do" → missing verb structure. Correct is “could be difficult to do” or more natural: “could be difficult to pull off.”
3. "how do you handle it" → tense consistency; better as “how would you manage the result” in a hypothetical/future scenario.

I think the idea of Oscar's advice about a float brushing and painting a picture during a parade would make the parade **unforgettable**, though it could be difficult to **pull off**. Think about a parade going through a street — at one end, the brush **starts** painting, but by the time it **finishes**, how would you manage the result?

我认为 Oscar 建议的“在游行中由花车刷子绘画”的创意会让这场游行令人难忘，尽管实现起来可能有些困难。想象一下，一场游行穿过街道，一端开始刷画，当走到尽头时，该如何收尾呢？

I think the idea of Oscar's advice about **a float brushing and painting a picture** during a parade would make the parade unforgettable, though it might be difficult to **pull off**. Imagine a float painting as it moves down the street — once the painting is finished, should it start again? Then some people would see **the creative process**, while others would only **see the finished work**, which might ruin the overall experience.

我觉得 Oscar 建议的“在游行中由花车刷漆作画”的想法确实能让这场游行令人难忘，但实现起来可能很难。试想一下，当花车一边移动一边画画时，画作完成后要重新开始画吗？这样一来，一部分观众看到的是绘画的过程，而另一部分只能看到完成的作品，整体观赏体验可能会被破坏。
