# How to Avoid Doing Chores - B3

Lin's Blog

Published: November 15

Are you tired of doing chores at home? Do you wish you could just relax while everything gets done? I have **a breakthrough idea**! Here's my advice:

**Form a Union with Family or Roommates**

First, **join forces** with your family or roommates. Create a union at home. Think through what chores you hate the most. Those who are part of the union can take turns doing chores. This way, you do less, and everyone shares the load!

**Go on Strike When Needed**

If the union idea doesn't work, it might be time to strike! Stay in bed or watch TV while everyone else does the chores. Tell them, 'I deserve a break!' People will soon get tired of your presence and might just do the work themselves. It's a lazy person's dream come true.

**Celebrate Small Breakthroughs**

Celebrate every little win. Did you manage to do one less chore today? Have a mini party! Got someone else to take out the trash? High five your roommate! These small breakthroughs will keep your spirits high while doing the bare minimum.

Remember, it's all about making life easier for yourself. With a union and some clever strikes, you can master the art of being lazy at home!

Remember: Don't work too much!

如何避免做家务

Lin 的博客

发布日期：11 月 15 日

你是否已经厌倦了在家做家务？你是否希望自己可以轻松地放松，而一切都自动搞定？我有一个突破性的想法！这是我的建议：

**与家人或室友成立联盟**

首先，与家人或室友联合起来。在家里成立一个联盟。想一想你最讨厌哪些家务。联盟成员可以轮流做家务。这样，你做得更少，每个人都分担任务！

**必要时罢工**

如果联盟的想法行不通，也许是时候罢工了！赖在床上或看电视，让别人做家务。告诉他们：“我需要休息！” 很快，他们就会厌倦你的存在，可能就自己把事情做了。这是懒人的梦想成真。

**庆祝小小的突破**

庆祝每一个小胜利。今天少做了一项家务？来个小派对吧！让别人帮你倒垃圾？和室友击个掌！这些小小的突破会让你在做最少事情时保持好心情。

记住，这一切都是为了让自己的生活更轻松。有了联盟和一些巧妙的罢工，你就能掌握在家偷懒的艺术！

记住：不要工作太多！

## Sentences

- 首先，与家人或室友联合起来。
  - First, **join forces** with your family or roommates.
  - In this sentence, "forces" is used metaphorically, not literally.
  - Here, "join forces" means to work together with someone to achieve a common goal. The word "**forces**" refers to the **combined power, efforts, or resources** of the people involved — like when armies combine their troops in battle, but in everyday English, it just means teaming up.
  - so:
    - **join forces** = unite your efforts, work together, cooperate.
    - In your sentence, it means: **team up with your family or roommates to do something together**.

## Speaking & Writing

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

I really like the idea of doing chores together with my family members because it **turns** a boring task **into** an opportunity to **spend quality time** with them. In my opinion, it’s a clever way to share responsibilities fairly and make the work feel lighter. This is definitely my favorite suggestion from Lin’s advice. On the other hand, I don’t think going on strike is a good idea, because it could create tension instead of encouraging cooperation.

我非常喜欢和家人一起做家务的想法，因为这能把一项无聊的任务变成与他们共度美好时光的机会。在我看来，这是一种聪明的方法，可以公平分担责任，让工作变得轻松一些。这无疑是我在 Lin 的建议中最喜欢的一个。另一方面，我认为罢工不是一个好主意，因为它可能会引发紧张，而不是促进合作。

### 🌟 Writing Band 7.0+

Among Lin’s suggestions, I most appreciate the idea of doing chores together with family members. This approach not only ensures that responsibilities are shared fairly, but also creates valuable opportunities to **strengthen** family **bonds**. Working as a team can transform **mundane household tasks** into moments of cooperation and even enjoyment. Personally, I believe this is the most practical and positive suggestion. In contrast, the idea of going on strike seems **counterproductive**, as it may lead to misunderstandings or conflict. Ultimately, cooperation and mutual support are far more effective in maintaining a harmonious household environment.

在 Lin 的建议中，我最欣赏与家人一起做家务的想法。这种方式不仅能确保公平分担责任，还能创造宝贵的机会来加强家庭纽带。以团队的方式合作，可以将枯燥的家务活转化为合作甚至享受的时刻。我个人认为这是最实用、最积极的建议。相比之下，罢工的想法似乎适得其反，因为它可能导致误解或冲突。归根结底，合作与互相支持在维持和谐的家庭氛围方面要有效得多。

This version demonstrates a clear central opinion, develops it with supporting arguments, and contrasts it with an alternative view. It uses advanced vocabulary (“counterproductive,” “maintaining a harmonious household environment”) and varied sentence structures, including complex and compound sentences.
