# Horoscopes Aren’t Real

Eddy and Bea are in a coffee shop. Bea is reading the newspaper.

- **Bea**: Hmm, this is interesting…
- **Eddy**: What?
- **Bea**: I’m reading my horoscope. It says I’ll help someone today.
- **Eddy**: Horoscopes aren’t real. A newspaper can’t tell you about your future.
- **Bea**: Well, I read my horoscope every day, and it’s usually right.
- **Eddy**: OK … Can I read my horoscope?
- **Bea**: Sure.

**Bea gives the newspaper to Eddy and spills his coffee.**

- **Bea**: Oh no!
  - Now there’s coffee on your shirt!
- **Eddy**: And I have an important meeting in ten minutes!
- **Bea**: Don’t worry! I have an extra sweater in my bag.

**Bea gives Eddy her sweater.**

- **Eddy**: I can’t wear this! It’s your favorite sweater!
- **Bea**: Hmm… When were you born?
- **Eddy**: October fourth.
- **Bea**: October fourth.
- **Eddy**: That doesn’t mean anything.
- **Bea**: Oh, yeah? Then listen to this.
  - Your horoscope says:
  - You will have a very good day today if you let a friend help you.
- **Eddy**: OK, Bea. I’ll wear your sweater.
