# Holiday Request - B2

From: bea@duomail.co

To: bob granger@duomail.co

**Subject: Holiday Request**

Dear Mr. **Granger**:

Although I appreciate the week-long break we're getting for the winter holiday, there are a number of **convincing** reasons why I should keep working.

As you know, Steve in the marketing department accidentally deleted our sales spreadsheet.

I'll happily recreate it if it means avoiding any uncomfortable questions about marriage with my aunt Carol at my family's holiday party.

After my recent breakup, I'd prefer to focus on myself — and a nice, simple spreadsheet.

Also, someone needs to take care of the office plants. I'd rather water all forty of our plants than listen to my aunt Jess.

Nothing makes me feel **inadequate** like hearing about how my cousin started her own company while raising three kids, training for a marathon, and volunteering as a firefighter.

Most importantly, our cleaning staff needs a break. They're supposed to come to the office to clean the carpets, but I'll gladly do it for them.

I'd rather spend the holiday **scrubbing** carpet stains on my hands and knees than explaining to my uncle Devon for the **hundredth** time that the earth is not flat.

Additionally, I'll gladly do these tasks for free! Just please, please allow me to work so I can avoid my family this holiday.

Your hardest worker,

Bea

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**If you were Bea, would you keep working? Why or why not?**

If I were Bea, I wouldn’t keep working. **After all**, holidays **are meant** for us to relax and recharge. If I really didn’t feel like seeing my family, I would just **come up with** a polite excuse. I think it’s important to take a proper break during the holidays.

如果我是 Bea，我就不会继续工作。毕竟，假期就是为了让我们放松和充电。如果我真的不想见家人，我会找个委婉的理由推辞。我觉得在假期好好休息是很重要的。

### Practice History

**If you were Bea, would you keep working? Why or why not?**

If I were Bea, I would not keep working. **Holidays are** supposed to let us relax, recharge ourselves. If I didn't want to see my family, **I would** just **give** them any excuse.

> Corrections:

1. “Holidays are supposed to let us relax, recharge ourselves.” 建议改成 “relax and recharge” 更简洁自然，不需要 ourselves。
2. “give them any excuse” 建议改成 “give them an excuse” 更符合自然用法，因为此处“any”显得不必要且口气生硬。

If I were Bea, I would not keep working. Holidays are supposed to let us relax and recharge. If I didn’t want to see my family, I would just **give them an excuse**.

如果我是 Bea，我不会继续工作。假期本该让我们放松和充电。如果我不想见家人，我就会随便找个理由搪塞他们。

If I were Bea, I wouldn't keep working on holiday. It's a holiday, I'm supposed to have some private time and relax. If I don't want to see my family, then I just don't meet them. I must have some rest.

> 1. "on holiday" → should be **"during the holiday"** for clarity and natural phrasing.
> 2. "I'm supposed to have some private time and relax." → better phrased as **"I’m supposed to have some time to myself and relax."**
> 3. "then I just don't meet them" → more natural as **"then I simply won’t meet them."**
> 4. "I must have some rest." → better phrased as **"I need to get some rest."**

If I were Bea, I **wouldn't** keep working **during** the holiday. It's a holiday—I’m supposed to have some time to myself and relax. If I don't want to see my family, then I simply won’t meet them. I need to get some rest.

如果我是 Bea，我不会在假期里继续工作。假期本来就是应该留点时间给自己放松。如果我不想见家人，那我就不见他们。我需要休息一下。

If I were Bea, I ~~don't~~ **necessarily** need to keep working. Not **being** willing to attend **the** family party doesn't mean I must work. Just tell the family I have other **plans**. And **since** it's a holiday, it is better to relax.

necessarily: 英 /ˌnesəˈserəli/, 美 /ˌnesəˈserəli/

> - **"If I were Bea, I don't necessarily..."** – This is a mixed conditional mistake. “If I were” is subjunctive (hypothetical), so the correct verb form is **“wouldn’t”**, not “don’t.”
> - **"Not being willing to attend the family party..."** – grammatically okay but sounds a bit awkward and formal. Consider rephrasing.
> - **"Just tell the family I have other plans."** – grammatically fine.
> - **"Since it’s a holiday, it is better to relax."** – sounds slightly stiff; can be more natural with “it’s better to” or “you’d better.”

If I were Bea, I **wouldn’t necessarily** need to keep working. **Not wanting** to attend the family party doesn’t mean I must work. Just tell the family I have other plans. And since **it’s** a holiday, **it’s** better to relax.

If I were Bea, I ~~won't~~ keep working. First, it's a holiday, I need to relax, don't want to meet some family member is ~~a~~ easy problem, just give them any reason and don't meet them. Second, ~~do~~ other people's job for free will harm the job market and befenits no one.

If I were Bea, I **wouldn't** keep working. First, it's a holiday, I need to relax, **I** don't want to meet some family **members, it's an** easy problem, just give them any reason and don't meet them. Second, doing other people's job for free will harm the job market and **benefits** no one.

> - **"it's a holiday, I need to relax, I don't want..."** – This is a **run-on sentence**; it needs punctuation or conjunctions to separate ideas clearly.
> - **"members, it's an easy problem"** – same issue: should be split into clearer sentences.
> - **"benefits no one"** – grammatically okay, but in this structure, the verb should agree with the compound subject "doing other people's job..." → it **benefit**s no one (so this part is actually correct).

If I were Bea, I wouldn't keep working. First, it's a holiday**—**I need to relax. I don't want to meet some family members. It's an easy problem**:** just give them any reason and don't meet them. Second, doing other people's jobs for free will harm the job market and benefits no one.

If I were Bea, I **wouldn't** keep working during the holidays. If I didn't want to spend time with my family, I would just find some other excuse **not to go** to the family party.
