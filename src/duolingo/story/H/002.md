# Happy Camper - B2

Lin's **lounging** on the couch, watching a movie in the living room, when her grandmother Lucy enters.

- **Lucy**: Lin, I have a date coming over for dinner tonight.
- **Lin**: Cool. What are you cooking for us?
- **Lucy**: No, Lin. I want some privacy. Can you please go somewhere else tonight, like your friend Bea's apartment?
- **Lin**: I can't because Bea's parents are visiting. But I guess I can go camping tonight.
- **Lucy**: Are you sure?
- **Lin**: Yeah, camping will allow me to reconnect with nature. Plus, it's free.

Later, Lucy and her date are cooking dinner.

- **Date**: Do you smell smoke? Is there a fire in your backyard?
- **Lucy**: Wait here. I'll go investigate.

Lucy goes to the backyard and sees that Lin **is setting up a tent** and trying to start a fire.

- **Lucy**: Lin, what are you doing?
- **Lin**: Enjoying the beauty of nature.
- **Lucy**: In my backyard?!
- **Lin**: Don't worry! Focus on your date.
- **Lucy**: Please don't burn anything down.

Lucy returns to the kitchen. She and Marco finish cooking and begin to eat.

- **Marco**: Is there someone outside your window?
- **Lucy**: Excuse me again.

Lucy goes to the backyard and sees Lin holding her laptop up to the window.

- **Lucy**: What are you doing now?
- **Lin**: Sorry! I need to be closer to the window because the Wi-Fi won't reach my tent.
- **Lucy**: What happened to connecting with nature!
- **Lin**: Nature doesn't have movies ... but I'll try.

Just then, Marco walks outside.

- **Lucy**: Marco! Just go inside. I'll be right back.
- **Marco**: Wait, were you trying to surprise me with this cool **campsite**? I love camping!
- **Lucy**: Really?
- **Marco**: Absolutely. Sleeping under the stars is so romantic!
- **Lin**: That's perfect. You two stay here, and I'll go inside to finish my movie.
