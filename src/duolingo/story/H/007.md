# How to Make Excuses - B3

Lin's Blog

Published: October 5

Ever been caught in a situation where you needed a quick excuse? Stop stressing! Making excuses can be easy, even fun, if you know how.

Here's my advice:

**Use Time Travel**

Not literally, of course! But say something happened 'prior to" something. Like, "Oh, I had planned to help, but prior to that, I had been really busy!" People love a good mystery timeline. It's like magic!

**Blame Technology**

Everyone knows technology can be tricky. Say, "I would have sent out the email, but my computer got stuck!" Given that tech problems are common, no one questions them. Always keep this excuse in your pocket!

**Turn Mistakes into Misunderstandings**

Sometimes, you just need to admit to a misunderstanding. "I didn't mean to send out that photo to everyone!" followed by a sheepish grin can go a long way. Whoops! It's the kind of oops that people find hard to stay mad at.

Remember, life is about having fun and not taking things too seriously. Enjoy the art of making excuses!

Remember: Don't work too much!

  - Not literally, of course! But say something happened 'prior to" something. Like, "Oh, I had planned to help, but prior to that, I had been really busy!"
- “我不是故意把那张照片发给所有人的！”再配上一个不好意思的微笑，往往能起很大作用。

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Which excuse from Lin's advice is your favorite?**

To be honest, I don’t really like any of the excuses mentioned, but if I had to pick one, I’d go with the idea of **turning mistakes** into misunderstandings. It feels like the most **natural** and **relatable** one, especially because in real life, people often use this to avoid taking full responsibility. I’ve seen all three types of excuses used in real situations, but this one stands out. After all, nobody is perfect — sometimes, having an excuse makes things a bit easier to handle.

说实话，我并不特别喜欢提到的任何借口，但如果非要选一个的话，我会选择把错误说成误会这个方式。这种借口听起来最自然，也最贴近现实生活，毕竟人们经常用这种方法来避免承担全部责任。我在现实中也见过三种借口都被使用过，但这个最让我印象深刻。毕竟，没有人是完美的 — 有时候，有个借口确实能让事情更容易处理一点。

### Practice History

**Which excuse from Lin's advice is your favorite?**

Help Phrases: I like/ My favorite excuse/ The best part

I don't like any of them. Actually, in real life, I can tell all three **excuses** are used. My favorite one is **turning** mistakes into misunderstandings if I must choose. The best part is we cannot do **everything correctly**, we just need some excuses.

> Corrections:

1. “can tell all three excuses are used” → should be “can see all three excuses being used” for natural phrasing.
2. “if I must choose” → slightly formal, “if I have to choose” sounds more natural in conversation.
3. “we cannot do everything correctly” → more natural as “we can’t do everything perfectly”.
4. Added “that” for clarity.

I don’t like any of them. Actually, in real life, I can **see** all three excuses being used. **If I have to choose**, my favorite is **turning** mistakes into misunderstandings. The best part is that we can’t do everything **perfectly** — sometimes we just need an excuse.

我不喜欢其中任何一个。其实，在现实生活中，我看到这三种借口都被用过。如果必须选择，我最喜欢的是把错误说成误会。最妙的部分是我们不可能事事都做对 — 有时候我们就是需要一些借口。
