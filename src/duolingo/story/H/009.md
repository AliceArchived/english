# How to Live Like a Pirate - B3

Lin's Blog

Published: October 15

Have you ever wanted to be a pirate, but you don't have a ship? Don't worry! You can still be a pirate. No ship needed! Here's my advice:

**Make a Pirate Flag**

Every pirate needs a flag. But you don't need a ship to have one! You can put a pirate flag in your room or your backyard. Our flag is easy to make. Draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of cloth. Now you have a pirate flag!

Conquer Your Space

Pirates conquer places all the time. You can conquer your space too. This means you should make your room look like a pirate's place. Put up maps, swords, and maybe even a toy parrot. Now you have conquered your room!

Talk Like a Pirate

Pirates have their own way of talking. You can start using pirate words, like "Arrr!" and "Matey!" When you meet friends, say, "Ahoy!" It makes everything more fun. Now that the internet exists, you can even find pirate words online.

Being a pirate is all about adventure and fun. You don't need a ship to enjoy the pirate life. With a flag, your space, and pirate talk, you're ready to go.

Remember: Don't work too much!

## Vocabulary

- skull: 英 /skʌl/, 美 /skʌl/
  - n. 头盖骨，脑壳

## Style

- "Have you ever wanted to be a pirate, but you don't have a ship?"
  - Style suggestion: "Have you ever wanted to be a pirate but don’t have a ship?"
  - The comma before “but” is optional; omitting it keeps tone more fluid and casual.
- "No ship needed!"
  - Style suggestion: "No ship required!"
  - “Required” sounds smoother, though “needed” is acceptable for tone — optional change.
- "Put up maps, swords, and maybe even a toy parrot."
  - Style suggestion: "**Hang up maps**, **display swords**, maybe even **add a toy parrot**."
  - More vivid verbs to enhance imagery; original is fine, but this is more pirate-themed in tone.
- "Now that the internet exists, you can even find pirate words online."
  - Style suggestion: "**With the internet**, you can even find pirate words online."
  - Smoother flow; “now that the internet exists” sounds overly formal for the casual blog voice.

## Sentences

- 在一块布上画一个骷髅和交叉骨头的图案。
  - Draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of cloth.
  - cloth: fabric

**What part of Lin's pirate advice is best?**

Personally, I really like Lin’s **pirate advice**. The best part, in my opinion, is the idea that you don’t actually need a ship to live like a pirate. I find that especially interesting because it means anyone can embrace the pirate lifestyle just by focusing on the theme and attitude. It’s more about **the spirit of adventure and creativity** than owning a real ship. That makes it feel fun and easy to try, even for people like me who live far from the sea.

就我个人而言，我非常喜欢 Lin 的海盗建议。在我看来，最棒的部分是你其实不需要一艘船就可以过上海盗般的生活。我觉得这特别有趣，因为它意味着任何人只要专注于主题和态度，都可以体验这种风格。这更像是一种冒险和创意的精神，而不是必须拥有一艘真正的船。这让人觉得有趣又容易尝试，甚至像我这样住在内陆的人也能参与其中。
