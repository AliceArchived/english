# Who's Coming to Dinner?

**Lucy is making soup. Lin comes into the kitchen.**

- **Lucy**: Guess who’s coming to dinner tonight?
- **Lin**: Well, you’re making your **famous** fish soup, so it’s probably someone special.
- **Lucy**: Yes! It’s someone very special.
- **Lin**: Is your friend, the famous actress, coming to dinner?
- **Lucy**: No, she’s working on a film right now.
  - It’s someone more important. You can’t wear pajamas!
- **Lin**: Oh, really? Alright, I’ll wear something else!

**Lin goes to her room and puts on a shirt and jeans.**

- **Lin**: So, is it your friend, Victor?! Is he back from taking photos of wild horses in Argentina?
- **Lucy**: No, he’s photographing lions in India now.
- **Lin**: Is it the **astronaut** you worked with?
- **Lucy**: No, he’s getting ready to go to Mars.
- **Lin**: Wait … Is this a date for me, Grandma?
  - I don’t need help with dating.
- **Lucy**: Of course not!

**Someone knocks on the door. It’s Lucy’s friend, Frank.**

- **Lucy**: Lin, this is Frank. He helps people with their resumes.
- **Frank**: Hi, Lin! Your grandma really wanted us to meet.
  - She said that you needed to find a job.
- **Lin**: Ugh, I’m going to put my pajamas back on.
