# Why You Should Yawn - B3

Lin's Blog

Published: December 5

Have you ever wondered why we yawn? Maybe you'll stop yawning if you have a coffee. But the thing is, yawning is good for you! Here's my advice:

**Yawn to Relax**

Believe it or not, yawning helps relax your muscles! When you yawn, your muscles get a little stretch. It feels nice, right? So, don't hide your yawns. Let them out and enjoy the stretch.

**Breathe and Be Happy**

Yawning brings more air to your lungs, which is a good thing! It helps you feel more awake. Breathing fresh air might be better, but yawning works too. Maybe next time you're tired, try yawning a few times.

**Yawning is Contagious Fun**

Have you noticed that when someone yawns, you start yawning too? It's a funny thing! Yawning is like a game everyone plays without thinking. So, if you yawn, you might just make someone else yawn, too. Spread the yawning joy!

So, the next time you yawn, remember that it's helpful. Your muscles will thank you, and you might even help a friend yawn, too!

Remember: Don't work too much!

## Vocabulary

## Style

1.  "you'll stop yawning if you have a coffee"
    1. Correction: you'll stop yawning if you have some coffee
    2. 🔍 Issue: “a coffee” is informal/slang in some dialects, but “**some coffee**” is more standard in writing.
2.  "maybe better, but yawning works too"
    1. Correction: might be better, but yawning works too
    2. 🔍 Issue: The original says “Breathing fresh air might be better” earlier, so this repeat should be consistent — not “maybe better.”

## Sentences

**What part of yawning surprised you most?**

What surprised me the most was learning that yawning is not just a sign of being tired, but it can actually help us become more **alert** and even **improve our mood**. I was especially surprised when Lin mentioned that yawning helps people wake up and feel happier. Before reading the article, I always thought yawning only happened when we were exhausted. I didn’t realize it had such a positive and useful function. This really changed the way I see something so ordinary.

最让我惊讶的是，了解到打哈欠不仅仅是疲劳的表现，它实际上还能帮助我们更清醒，甚至提升情绪。我尤其惊讶 Lin 提到打哈欠有助于人们醒来并感到更快乐。读这篇文章之前，我总以为打哈欠只是因为累了。我没想到它竟然有这么积极而有用的功能。这真的改变了我对这个日常行为的看法。

### Practice History

**What part of yawning surprised you most?**

Helpful Phrases: I was surprised/ What surprised me/ I didn't know that

I was surprised when Lin said **that** yawning will help people **wake up** and be happy. What surprised me was **that** I used to think yawning meant we were tired. I didn't know that it would help us to **wake up**.

> Corrections:

1. Replaced “will help” with “can help” for factual/general tone (present tense for general truth).
2. Reworded “be happy” to “feel happy”, which is more natural.
3. Minor tense/modal adjustment: “would help” → “could help”, since it refers to a general fact, not a hypothetical scenario.

I was surprised when Lin said that yawning can help people wake up and feel happy. What surprised me was that I used to think yawning meant we were tired. I didn't know that it could actually help us wake up.

我很惊讶 Lin 说打哈欠可以帮助人们清醒并感到快乐。让我感到惊讶的是，我以前一直以为打哈欠是因为我们累了。我不知道打哈欠实际上可以帮助我们清醒过来。
