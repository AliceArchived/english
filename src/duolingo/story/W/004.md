# What a Great Tent!

Eddy and his son Junior are in a tent **in the woods** at night.

- **Eddy**: Are you having fun?
- **Junior**: No. This camping trip is terrible!
- **Eddy**: Do you like our new tent? It’s as big as a house!
- **Junior**: I like our real house.
- **Eddy**: Our camping beds are very soft.
- **Junior**: I can’t sleep right now!
- **Eddy**: We have a stove and a fridge.
- **Junior**: I am not hungry.
- **Eddy**: I also bought a special camping bathroom.
- **Junior**: I do like the special camping bathroom.
- **Eddy**: And we have a television, a radio, and video games!
- **Junior**: I know …
  - You’re trying very hard!
- **Eddy**: I don’t understand. What else do you need?
- **Junior**: I need the **bear** that’s outside the tent to leave!!!
- **Bear**: Grrr!
