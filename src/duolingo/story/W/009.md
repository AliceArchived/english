# Where's My Jacket?

Oscar knocks on Eddy's door. Eddy opens it.

- **Oscar**: Eddy, do you have the jacket I gave you last week?
- **Eddy**: Your blue jacket? Don't you hate that jacket?
- **Oscar**: I changed my mind. I really need it back now.
- **Eddy**: Sorry, but I gave the jacket to Lin!
- **Oscar**: What?! Why?
- **Eddy**: It didn't fit me.
- **Oscar**: Oh no. Well, maybe Lin will give it back to me.
- **Eddy**: Good luck!

Oscar runs to Lin's apartment.

- **Oscar**: Lin, Eddy told me he gave you my jacket...
- **Lin**: Yes! I loved it!
- **Oscar**: Oh good. Then you must still have it!
- **Lin**: No. I'm allergic to the material of the jacket. I gave it to Bea.
- **Oscar**: Ugh! I need it back!
- **Lin**: I think Bea is home now.

Oscar goes to Bea's apartment.

- **Bea**: Oscar! It's nice to see you!
- **Oscar**: Hello, Bea. I need my blue jacket back. Lin said she gave it to you.
- **Bea**: Oh! I'm sorry, it was such a warm jacket... I thought someone who needs it should have it.
  - I donated it to a store this morning.
- **Oscar**: Oh no!
- **Bea**: They close in an hour, so you need to hurry!

Oscar runs to the store. He gets there a few minutes before it closes. He talks to the **clerk**.

- **Oscar**: Hi! I am wondering if you have any blue jackets.
- **Clerk**: Oh! Actually, someone just donated one... here it is! It's only fifty dollars.
- **Oscar**: Only fifty dollars?!
- **Clerk**: Yes! It's a good deal. But we don't give refunds.
- **Oscar**: That's fine. I'll buy it.

Oscar gives her money and she puts the jacket into a bag.

- **Clerk**: Also, that jacket has a cool secret pocket!
- **Oscar**: You... found the secret pocket?
- **Clerk**: Yes! And you won't believe this: I found $500 in it! I donated it to our charity. It's going to help a lot of people.
- **Oscar**: That's ... very kind.
- **Clerk**: Well, enjoy your new jacket!

Oscar gives the bag back to her.

- **Oscar**: Actually, I don't need this jacket anymore. I think I'll donate it again.

## Vocabulary

- donated it to: 把它捐给了

## Writing

### Why did the clerk donate the $500?

Oscar/ because it / charity

Oscar forgot his money in the jacket and gave it to Eddy. Eddy gave it to Lin and Lin gave it to Bea. But Bea donated it to a charity. So Oscar had to buy it back to get the money. But the money was found by the clerk and donated to the charity.

### That's a lot of money! Describe what you'd like to do with $500.

$500 is not a lot of money these days because of the inflation. It can ~~only afford~~ to go to the supermarket once or twice.

Oscar gave his jacket to Eddy. After that, he remembered there was $500 in the jacket's secret pocket. He tried to get it back, even paid to buy it, but the money was taken, he couldn't get his money back.

> - “It can only afford to go to the supermarket” → should be **“It’s only enough to go to the supermarket once or twice.”**
> - “He tried to get it back, even paid to buy it, but the money was taken” → awkward phrasing; needs smoother transitions and clearer grammar.

$500 isn't a lot of money these days because of inflation. It's **only enough for** one or two **trips** to the supermarket.

Oscar gave his jacket to Eddy. Later, he remembered there was $500 in a secret pocket. He tried to get it back**—** **even offered to buy it** —but the money was already **gone**, and he couldn’t **recover** it.

由于通货膨胀，500 美元在现在已经不算很多了。可能只够去超市一两次。

奥斯卡把夹克送给了艾迪，之后他才想起夹克的隐秘口袋里有 500 美元。他试图拿回夹克，甚至愿意出钱买回，但钱已经被拿走了，他再也拿不回来了。

I would buy some ~~grocery~~ with $500. Because of inflation, such money ~~isn't much now~~.

> - “buy some grocery” → should be **“buy some groceries”** (plural noun).
> - “such money isn’t much now” → awkward phrasing; better as **“that amount of money doesn’t go far nowadays.”**

I would buy some **groceries** with $500. Because of inflation, that **amount of money** doesn’t **go far** nowadays.

我会用这 500 美元买些杂货。因为通货膨胀，这点钱现在已经不算多了。
