# Without a Paddle

Lucy and Lin are spending a day at the lake.

They decided to rent a boat.

- **Lin**: This is so nice.
- **Lucy**: Hmm... I'm not sure.
- **Lin**: Aren't you glad we rented this boat?
- **Lucy**: No. I wanted to go swimming.
- **Lin**: But we're still enjoying the lake.
- **Lucy**: You're right, it's nice.
- **Lin**: And now we have everything we need for the perfect afternoon: a great view, beautiful weather, wine, cheese...
  - Wait, where are our paddles?
- **Lucy**: Oops! I think I dropped them in the lake.
- **Lin**: Did you do that on purpose? Without paddles, we can't get out of the lake!
  - 你是故意那样做的吗？没有桨，我们无法离开湖面！
- **Lucy**: That's not a problem.

Lucy takes two swimsuits out of her bag.

- **Lucy**: Because we have these!
- **Lin**: You brought our swimsuits?! You planned this!
- **Lucy**: I told you I wanted to go swimming.
  - We went for a boat ride, like you wanted.
  - And now we're **going for a swim**, like I wanted!
