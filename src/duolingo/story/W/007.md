# What's the Recipe?

Vikram walks into a bakery.

- **Vikram**: Hi. My wife loves your apple **pastries**.
- **Man**: Cool.
- **Vikram**: I bake, too, but she says your pastries are better than anything I make.
  - Could you give me the recipe?
- **Man**: Absolutely not! My recipes are secret.
- **Vikram**: Ah, I'm sorry that I asked.
- **Man**: There's a line. Are you going to buy anything?
- **Vikram**: Yes. One box of apple pastries.
- **Man**: A whole box? You're trying to guess my recipe!
- **Vikram**: I'm sorry, I just have to know how to make them!
- **Man**: Please leave my store, and don't come back.

Vikaram looks shocked.

The next day, Bea nervously walks into the bakery.

- **Bea**: Uh, I would like...
- **Man**: Yes?
- **Bea**: One box of apple pastries.

Bea looks out the window, where Vikram is waiting.

The baker sees Vikram.

- **Man**: It's that guy! You're helping him steal my recipe. Get out!

Bea runs out of the store.

- **Bea**: I'm sorry, Vikram. I'm bad at lying.
- **Vikram**: It's fine.
- **Bea**: But how will you get the recipe?
- **Vikram**: I have a new plan.

One week later, Vikram walks into the bakery. He's holding a plate with an apple pastry on it.

- **Man**: It's you again! I told you not to come back!
- **Vikram**: I spent the whole week baking.
- **Man**: Were you trying to make my recipe?
- **Vikram**: Not exactly. Try one bite, and then I'll leave.
- **Man**: Fine.

The baker takes a bite of Vikram's pastry.

- **Man**: This doesn't taste like my apple pastry.
- **Vikram**: No.
- **Man**: It tastes better.
- **Vikram**: Thank you. My wife thinks so, too. And I'd like to give you my recipe.
- **Man**: Really? Why?
- **Vikram**: Because I believe good recipes should always be shared.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

I agree with the baker, **although** I think Vikram made **a clever attempt**. The baker is running a business, and his recipe is **a key part** of that, so it **makes sense** that he wants to protect it. It's like a trade secret, and sharing it could hurt his **competitive edge**. Vikram, on the other hand, is just baking for his wife, so he doesn’t need to be as **protective** of his own recipe. Still, I admire Vikram’s creativity—offering the baker a better recipe was a smart move. In the end, the baker might have appreciated it enough to share his own recipe.

我同意面包师的做法，虽然我觉得 Vikram 的尝试也很聪明。面包师是做生意的，他的配方是他成功的关键之一，所以他不愿意分享也是可以理解的，就像商业机密一样。如果随便公开可能会影响他的竞争力。而 Vikram 只是想为妻子做点心，所以他自己的配方并不需要保密。尽管如此，我很佩服 Vikram 的聪明，他提出一个更好的配方给面包师，算是一种交换。最后面包师可能也因为这个感到欣赏，愿意把自己的配方分享出来。

**competitive edge**

Competitive edge = a special advantage that helps a person, product, or company do better than others in a competition or market.

### Practice History

What do you think? Do you agree with Vikram or the baker? Why?

I agree with the baker but ~~Vikram's try is great~~. For the baker, he is running a business, the recipe actually is a business secret, so it makes sense not to tell anyone else. For Vikram, he just makes pastries for his wife, it doesn't matter if others know his **recipe**. But Vikram is smart, he offers a better recipe to the baker, the baker **probably** gives his recipe to Vikram in the end.

> Corrections:

1. "Vikram's try is great" → should be "**Vikram's effort was impressive**" or "a good try"
2. "the recipe actually is a business secret" → better phrased as "the recipe is **essentially** a trade secret"
3. "doesn't matter if others know his recipe" → better phrased: "it’s not a big deal if others know his recipe"

I agree with the baker, but I think **Vikram's effort was impressive**. From the baker’s **perspective**, he’s running a business, and the recipe is **essentially a trade secret**, so it makes sense that he doesn’t want to share it. Vikram, on the other hand, just wants to bake for his wife, so it's not a big deal if others know his recipe. **Still**, Vikram was smart — he **offered** the baker an even better recipe, so the baker **might have given** him his original recipe in the end.

Why use "might have given"?

- You’re talking about a guess about something that **could have already happened** in the past,
- But the story **doesn’t confirm it** — it leaves it open.

In this case: "The baker **might have given** his recipe to Vikram in the end."

You’re saying: “I don’t know if this happened, but maybe he gave it to him after the story ends.”

This fits perfectly with:

- A past situation (the story is finished)
- An uncertain outcome (you're speculating)

Why not use “might give”?

- "The baker might give his recipe to Vikram..." → ❌
  - That suggests the action could still happen in the future.
  - But the story already ended — so it’s not the future anymore.
