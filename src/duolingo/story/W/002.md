# Walking the Dogs - B3

Lily and Zari are sitting in Lily's room, looking at her broken guitar amp.

- **Zari**: We need to fix your amp before the concert!
- **Lily**: I know. But repairs cost too much.
- **Zari**: Let's make money! We could… sell lemonade?
- **Lily**: Too boring.
- **Zari**: Walking the dogs! People pay for that, right?
- **Lily**: You want us to get paid for walking other people's dogs?
- **Zari**: Yes! It's smart! And good exercise!
- **Lily**: Fine, but this is your idea.

The next day, Lily and Zari are each holding the **leashes** of several dogs.

- **Zari**: This is so fun! Look at all these cute dogs!
- **Lily**: I feel like a human knot. These leashes are all over the place.

Suddenly, one of the dogs pulls hard, and the others follow.

- **Zari**: Oh no! They're running!

The dogs **bolt**, dragging Lily and Zari across a park.

- **Zari**: We have to stop them!
- **Lily**: You think? I can barely hold on! My arms are going to fall off.

The dogs run into their school during lunch.

Students scream and jump on tables as the dogs race past.

- **Zari**: Oops… this is really bad.
- **Lily**: So bad. But kind of funny.

They finally catch the dogs outside the cafeteria.

- **Zari**: That was embarrassing.
- **Lily**: On the bright side, we don't need exercise now.
- **Zari**: And we didn't even make money!
- **Lily**: Forget that amp. Maybe we can play "quiet music" concerts instead.
