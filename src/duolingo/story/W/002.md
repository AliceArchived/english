# Walking the Dogs - B3

Lily and Zari are sitting in Lily's room, looking at her broken guitar amp.

- **Zari**: We need to fix your amp before the concert!
- **Lily**: I know. But repairs cost too much.
- **Zari**: Let's make money! We could… sell lemonade?
- **Lily**: Too boring.
- **Zari**: Walking the dogs! People pay for that, right?
- **Lily**: You want us to get paid for walking other people's dogs?
- **Zari**: Yes! It's smart! And good exercise!
- **Lily**: Fine, but this is your idea.

The next day, Lily and Zari are each holding the **leashes** of several dogs.

- **Zari**: This is so fun! Look at all these cute dogs!
- **Lily**: I feel like a human knot. These leashes are all over the place.

Suddenly, one of the dogs pulls hard, and the others follow.

- **Zari**: Oh no! They're running!

The dogs **bolt**, dragging Lily and Zari across a park.

- **Zari**: We have to stop them!
- **Lily**: You think? I can barely hold on! My arms are going to fall off.

The dogs run into their school during lunch.

Students scream and jump on tables as the dogs race past.

- **Zari**: Oops… this is really bad.
- **Lily**: So bad. But kind of funny.

They finally catch the dogs outside the cafeteria.

- **Zari**: That was embarrassing.
- **Lily**: On the bright side, we don't need exercise now.
- **Zari**: And we didn't even make money!
- **Lily**: Forget that amp. Maybe we can play "quiet music" concerts instead.

遛狗

Lily 和 Zari 坐在 Lily 的房间里，看着她坏掉的吉他音箱。

- **Zari**：我们得在音乐会前修好你的音箱！
- **Lily**：我知道。但修理费太贵了。
- **Zari**：我们去赚钱吧！我们可以……卖柠檬水？
- **Lily**：太无聊了。
- **Zari**：遛狗！人们会付钱的，对吧？
- **Lily**：你是说我们帮别人遛狗还要收钱？
- **Zari**：对啊！这很聪明！而且还是锻炼！
- **Lily**：好吧，但这是你的主意。

第二天，Lily 和 Zari 各自牵着几条狗的**狗绳**。

- **Zari**：太好玩了！看看这些可爱的狗！
- **Lily**：我感觉自己像个乱成一团的绳结。这些狗绳到处乱绕。

突然，其中一只狗猛地一冲，其他狗也跟着跑了起来。

- **Zari**：哦，不！它们跑了！

狗群**飞奔**，拖着 Lily 和 Zari 穿过公园。

- **Zari**：我们得拦住它们！
- **Lily**：废话？我都快抓不住了！我的胳膊要掉下来了。

这些狗跑进了学校的午餐时间。

学生们尖叫着跳上桌子，狗从旁边飞驰而过。

- **Zari**：糟糕……这可真糟。
- **Lily**：太糟了。但有点好笑。

她们终于在食堂外抓住了这些狗。

- **Zari**：太尴尬了。
- **Lily**：好的一面是，我们现在不用锻炼了。
- **Zari**：而且我们一分钱都没赚到！
- **Lily**：算了那个音箱吧。也许我们可以改办“静音音乐”演唱会。
