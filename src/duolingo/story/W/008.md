# Whatever Junior Wants

Eddy is getting ready to leave for his date.

Lin arrives.

- **Eddy**: Hi, Lin! Thank you for watching Junior.
  - When the babysitter said she couldn't come tonight, I didn't know what to do.
- **Lin**: I've never been a babysitter before, but it's probably pretty easy, right?
- **Eddy**: Never?
  - What are you going to do with Junior?
- **Lin**: Whatever Junior wants.
- **Eddy**: Please don't do whatever Junior wants.
  - He just likes to sit inside and play video games.
- **Lin**: Should I take him outside?
- **Eddy**: Yes, great idea.
- **Lin**: We can go for a ride on my **motorcycle**!
- **Eddy**: No! No **motorcycles**.
- **Lin**: Hmm. OK, no **motorcycles**.
  - We can go to my friend's rock concert. It's in an old, abandoned building.
- **Eddy**: An abandoned building?
- **Lin**: And If Junior gets hungry, the building is near a bar that has free fries.
- **Eddy**: A bar?
- **Lin**: But you don't have to drink a beer to get the fries.

- **Eddy**: Maybe you should stay here and play video games.
- **Lin**: OK, but that's less fun.
- **Eddy**: Oh no, I'm late!
  - Have fun. Please don't leave the apartment. Bye.

Eddy leaves. Junior walks into the room.

- **Lin**: You were right. Your plan was perfect!
- **Junior**: You really scared my dad.
  - And now I can play video games all night!
- **Lin**: You mean we can play video games all night.

## Writing

### What happened in the story?

In the story, the babysitter couldn't take care of Junior. So Lin would do it. But Lin and Junior were planning to play **video games** and they knew Eddy would not agree with it, so they thought out a strategy to make Eddy **agree to let** them to play video games.

> - “**agree to let them to play** video games” → 错误结构：**“let” 后不能再接 “to”**，应为 “agree to let them play”
> - “So Lin would do it.” → 结构太简略，建议更自然地写成 “so Lin offered to take over” 或 “so Lin volunteered to do it.”

In the story, the babysitter couldn’t take care of Junior, **so** Lin **offered** to do it. But Lin and Junior were planning to play video games, and they knew **Eddy wouldn’t agree**. So they **came up with** a strategy to **convince** Eddy to let them play.

在故事中，保姆无法照顾 Junior，于是 Lin 主动提出帮忙。但 Lin 和 Junior 其实打算玩电子游戏，他们知道 Eddy 不会同意，所以他们想出了一套策略来说服 Eddy 让他们玩。

This is a funny story. Eddy asked Lin to take care of Junior. But Junior **cooperated** with Lin and they scared Eddy **into allowing** them to play video games.

> - **cooperated with** → 语法正确，但在这个语境中，“**teamed up with**” 更自然，更有“合谋、联合起来”的感觉
>
> - **scared Eddy into allowing them to play** → 语法基本正确，但 “**into letting them play**” 更口语、更简洁
>
>   “scare someone into doing something” + 动词-ing 是标准结构

This is a funny story. Eddy asked Lin to take care of Junior. But Junior **teamed up with** Lin, and together they scared Eddy into letting them play video games.

这是一个有趣的故事。Eddy 请 Lin 照顾 Junior，但 Junior 和 Lin 联手，故意吓 Eddy，最终成功让他同意他们玩电子游戏。

这是一个非常关键的问题，特别是在**口语考试（如雅思）或写作**中复述故事时：

### ✅ **1. 用时态的基本原则：**

| 场景                                               | 建议使用时态                               | 原因                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **复述真实发生过的故事**（你读过/听过的）          | **一般过去时**                             | 因为事件已发生，强调“过去发生的动作”   |
| **复述书或电影剧情**（尤其是文学作品、动画、剧集） | **一般现在时**                             | 因为这是“虚构内容”，视为“现在正在发生” |
| **口语讲故事（自己经历）**                         | 一般用**过去时**，偶尔穿插现在时营造紧张感 | 更自然、口语化，有“临场感”             |

#### 现在时复述版：

In the story, the babysitter **can’t** take care of Junior, so Lin **offers** to do it. But Lin and Junior **want** to play video games, and they **know** Eddy won’t agree. So they **come up with** a strategy to **convince** him to say yes.

#### **Story Retelling – Present Tense Version**

In the story, Eddy is about to leave for his date, but the babysitter cancels at the last minute. Luckily, Lin shows up to help. Eddy is thankful, but also a bit worried because Lin has never **babysat** before.

Lin says she’ll just do whatever Junior wants, but Eddy immediately says that’s not a good idea — Junior only wants to stay inside and play video games. Eddy suggests taking him outside instead, and Lin **comes up with** some **wild ideas**, like riding a motorcycle or going to a rock concert in an abandoned building. She even mentions free fries at a bar nearby! Eddy gets more and more nervous.

Eventually, Eddy gives up and tells Lin to just stay home and play video games with Junior — at least that’s safer. Then he rushes out because he’s late.

After he leaves, Junior comes in and it turns out the whole thing was **his plan** all along! Lin says, “You were right. Your plan was perfect!” and Junior replies that now he can play video games all night. Lin corrects him — they can play together.

在这个故事中，Eddy 正准备出去约会，但临时保姆突然取消了。幸运的是，Lin 出现了愿意帮忙。Eddy 很感激，但也有点担心，因为 Lin 从没当过保姆。

Lin 说她会照 Junior 的意思去做，但 Eddy 马上表示反对，因为 Junior 只想待在家里打游戏。Eddy 建议带他出去走走，Lin 却开始出一些疯狂的主意，比如骑摩托车、去一个废弃建筑里的摇滚演唱会，甚至说附近的酒吧有免费薯条。Eddy 越来越紧张。

最后，Eddy 妥协了，说那就留在家里陪 Junior 打游戏吧——起码安全些。然后他匆忙离开，因为已经迟到了。

等他一走，Junior 出现了。原来这一切都是他设计好的计划！Lin 说：“你是对的，你的计划太完美了。” Junior 说他现在可以通宵打游戏，Lin 提醒他：“是**我们**可以通宵打游戏。”
