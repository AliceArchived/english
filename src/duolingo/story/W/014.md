# Writing an Award-Winning Memoir

Lin's Blog, November 22nd

It might not seem like there's much happening in my life, but I'm actually a serious writer working on a soon-to-be award-winning memoir about my many fascinating experiences. You can also write an amazing memoir if you follow these simple, Lin-approved tips.

**Create the Right Environment**

What would you say are the essential things you need to write a book? A desk, a pen, and a notebook, right?

Wrong! You only need an inspiring music playlist.

A carefully selected playlist will remind you of important moments in your life and provide a nice soundtrack for doing things other than writing too.

Creating the perfect playlist could take anywhere from a few hours to several years, but you can't write without one.

**Get the Right Writing Tools**

Even with an incredible playlist, you'll actually still need a pen and paper.

With the right pen, the memoir will basically write itself. And what kind of pen would be best? Well, you'll want to try at least seventy-eight before you make that decision.

You also need hundreds of notebooks even if you've never filled up a single one. That way, if inspiration does come, you can grab one of your many blank notebooks.

**Keep a Writing Schedule**

With a schedule, you won't feel guilty when you're not writing. I schedule one day of writing a month.

During the other 27-30 days, I enjoy my life - while telling everyone I meet that I'm writing a memoir.
