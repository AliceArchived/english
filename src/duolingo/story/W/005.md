# What Did I Miss? - B2

Oscar is sitting in a movie theatre. His friend Lin arrives, **stepping over** people to get to her seat.

- **Oscar**: You're late!
- **Lin**: I'm only twenty minutes late!

Lin puts her feet on the seat in front of her and loudly drinks from a massive soda cup.

- **Lin**: These seats are so uncomfortable ...
- **Oscar**: Lin, take your feet off the seat! This is a theatre, not your living room.
- **Lin**: I wish I could lie down.
- **Oscar**: Stop talking. You're being incredibly disrespectful and ruining everyone's movie-watching experience.

Someone in the audience yells at Oscar.

- **Woman**: Hey, guy with the moustache! Stop talking!
- **Oscar**: I'm not talking! She is!

Lin points at the screen.

- **Lin**: What did I miss? That elf is the villain, right?
- **Oscar**: If you had arrived on time, you would know!

Someone starts throwing popcorn at them.

- **Woman**: Stop talking!
- **Lin**: OK, Oscar. If you tell me what I missed, I'll be quiet for the rest of the movie.
- **Oscar**: Fine!
  - That guy is a prince, but he doesn't know because an elf kidnapped him when he was a baby.
- **Lin**: Why?
- **Oscar**: I don't know the motivations of elves, Lin.

A movie theater employee approaches Oscar.

- **Employee**: Sir, talking during the movie isn't allowed.
- **Oscar**: I was trying to get my friend to be quiet so everyone can enjoy the movie!
- **Employee**: Well, I'm sorry, you need to leave.

Oscar is escorted to the lobby by the employee. As he tries to argue, he sees Lin casually walk out of the theater.

- **Oscar**: Lin? Aw, you didn't have to leave the movie just because I was kicked out.
- **Lin**: I didn't. I just realized that I'd rather watch it at home.

## Writing

### When you go to the movies, are you more like Oscar or Lin? Explain your answer.

I'm more like Oscar when I go to the movies. Actually, I don't really like Lin in this situation —She's not responsible. And she doesn't respect other people.

I'm **definitely** more like Oscar when I go to the movies. **Honestly**, I don’t really like **how Lin behaves** in this situation — she’s quite **irresponsible** and doesn’t **seem to** respect others' feelings or opinions.

**亮点解释：**

- “I’m definitely more like…” 更自然、加强语气；
- “how Lin behaves” 比 “I don’t like Lin” 更聚焦在行为上，语气更客观；
- “doesn’t seem to respect others’ feelings or opinions” 是比 “doesn’t respect people” 更具体、更高级的表达。
