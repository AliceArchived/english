# Whale Watching

Eddy and his son, Junior, are whale watching on a boat. Junior is playing a video game on his phone.

- **Eddy**: Isn't this **terrific**, Junior? I can't wait until we see a whale!
- **Junior**: I can't wait to get to the next level of my game!
- **Eddy**: Junior, why aren't you paying attention? A whale could jump out of the water at any time!

Junior looks at the ocean, then he looks back at his game.

- **Junior**: I don't see any whales.
- **Eddy**: You **have** to be patient and watch the water!
- **Junior**: But I'm almost on level fifty in my game now!
- **Eddy**: I can't believe you don't care about this.

A woman walks over to Eddy.

- **Sofia**: My daughter isn't paying attention either.

She points at her daughter, who is texting on her phone.

- **Eddy**: I don't understand. When I was a kid, I loved whale watching.
- **Sofia**: I loved whale watching too!
- **Eddy**: My name's Eddy. And you are...?
- **Sofia**: Well, hello, Eddy! I'm Sofia.
- **Eddy**: Nice to meet you, Sofia.
- **Sofia**: It's great to meet another parent who understands.
- **Eddy**: Yes, kids never pay attention to important things.

Behind Eddy, a **giant** whale jumps out of the water. Junior screams.

- **Junior**: Oh wow! Dad, look!
- **Eddy**: Junior, I don't want to hear about your video game right now.

Another whale jumps out of the water behind them.

- **Girl**: Mom! You missed it!
- **Sofia**: What?
- **Junior**: You missed the whales!
- **Eddy**: No!
- **Junior**: Adults never pay attention to important things!

## Writing

### Would you like to go see whales? Why?

Yes, I would love to see whales. I only see them on TV, but never see them in real life. If I can see them alive, it would be interesting.

> 1. “but never see them in real life” 时态不一致，建议改为 “**but I’ve never seen them in real life**”。
> 2. “If I can see them alive” 建议改为 “**If I could see them in person**” 或 “**If I could see them in real life**”；“alive” 在这里容易引起误解（像是“没死”）。
> 3. “it would be interesting” 可以更具体，如 “**it would be an amazing experience**” 更自然。

Yes, I would love to see whales. **I’ve only seen** them on TV, but **I’ve never seen** them in real life. If I **could** see them **in person**, it would be **an amazing experience**.

是的，我很想去看鲸鱼。我只在电视上看过，从来没有在现实中见过。如果能亲眼看到它们，那一定是一次很棒的体验。

**[Expanded Answer]**
Yes, I would love to see whales. I’ve only seen them on TV or in documentaries, but I’ve never had the chance to see them in real life. Whales are such majestic and intelligent animals, and watching them swim in the ocean would be unforgettable. I think it would feel peaceful and exciting at the same time. If I could join a whale-watching tour one day, especially somewhere like Alaska or Iceland, it would definitely be a dream come true.

**[Chinese]**
是的，我非常想去看鲸鱼。我只在电视或纪录片中见过它们，从来没有机会在现实中看到。鲸鱼是一种非常宏伟又聪明的动物，看着它们在海洋中游动一定会令人难忘。我觉得那种体验会同时让人感到平静又兴奋。如果有一天我能参加一次观鲸之旅，特别是在像阿拉斯加或冰岛这样的地方，那对我来说一定是梦想成真。

**[Shortened Part 1 Answer]**
Yes, I’d love to see whales. I’ve only seen them on TV, but never in real life. I think it would be really exciting and peaceful to watch them in the ocean. If I ever get the chance to join a whale-watching tour, I’d definitely go.

**[Chinese]**
是的，我很想看鲸鱼。我只在电视上见过，从来没亲眼看过。我觉得在海上看它们会很兴奋又很放松。如果有机会参加观鲸旅行，我一定会去。

**[Shortened Part 1 – Negative Answer]**
To be honest, I’m not that interested in seeing whales. I think they’re amazing animals, but I don’t really enjoy being on a boat or spending time at sea. I’d rather watch a documentary from the comfort of home.

**[Chinese]**
说实话，我对看鲸鱼不太感兴趣。我觉得它们是很棒的动物，但我不太喜欢坐船或待在海上。我更愿意在家里舒服地看纪录片。
