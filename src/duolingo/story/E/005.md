# Eddy's Big Debut

Eddy leads Junior through a crowded studio. It's his first day working on a toilet paper commercial.

- **Eddy**: Junior, I can't believe that I had to bring you to work after your babysitter got sick.
- **Junior**: Yeah, I told her **not** to eat the **leftovers** in our fridge.
- **Eddy**: Why don't you sit in that chair while I'm working?

Junior watches as the director begins filming. Eddy stands nervously in front of the camera holding a large pack of toilet paper.

- **Director**: Action!
- **Eddy**: Now that's, uh, a good deal.
- **Director**: Cut!
  - Can you show more **emotion**?
  - How do you feel when you see toilet paper?
- **Eddy**: Relieved.
- **Director**: Ugh!
  - Why don't you say the line like it's a secret?

Eddy nods, then he says the line again in the same way.

- **Eddy**: Now, that's, uh, a good deal.

The director angrily throws her hat on the ground.

Seeing that the director is losing her patience, Junior decides to help his dad.

- **Junior**: Say it like you're talking to a date!

Eddy **panics** and begins to sweat and **stutter**.

- **Director**: That's it! You're fired! Your 10-year-old son could do a better job!
- **Junior**: I'm actually 8, but I'm as mature as a 12-year-old.
- **Director**: Wait, yes, a cute kid would be perfect for this role! I really believe he uses toilet paper.
- **Eddy**: Do I not seem like I use toilet paper?
- **Director**: I'll need your permission to hire your son.
- **Eddy**: Hmm. On the one hand, this could be fun for Junior.
  - But on the other hand, he'll miss a lot of school. But then again, he could become famous...
- **Junior**: Dad, you can stop right there. I don't want to be in a toilet paper commercial.
- **Eddy**: Really? Why not?
- **Junior**: I don't want people associating my face with toilet paper.
- **Eddy**: Alright, let's go home, son.

Eddy picks up **a massive pack of** toilet paper **as** he **turns to** look at the **furious** director.

- **Eddy**: We're keeping this.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**If you were Eddy, what would you have done in this situation?**

If I were Eddy, I would have **taken** the job more **seriously** and prepared in advance. Since it was a **professional** task, I think it’s important to practice **beforehand**. And if I still felt unprepared, I would have looked for someone to coach or train me — just to make sure I could do it well.

如果我是 Eddy，我会更认真对待这份工作，并提前做好准备。既然是专业任务，我觉得事先练习是很重要的。如果我还是觉得自己准备不足，我就会找人来指导我 — 确保自己能胜任。

---

If I were Eddy, I would have made the same decision. I’d have given it a try first, and if the director wasn’t satisfied, I would’ve **stepped aside** — but I’d still keep a positive attitude. Sometimes, what matters most is that you do your best.

如果我是 Eddy，我也会做出同样的决定。我会先努力尝试一下，如果导演不满意，我会选择退出 — 但仍然保持积极的态度。有时候，最重要的是你尽力了。

### Practice History

**If you were Eddy, what would you have done in this situation?**

> Corrections:

1. **"do a better preparation"** → should be
   - **"do better preparation"** (no article needed with uncountable noun).
2. Added **"so"** for clarity: **"It's a job, so I would practice in advance."**

If I were Eddy, I would **do better preparation**. It's a job, **so** I would practice in advance. If I couldn't do it, I would hire someone to train me.

如果我是 Eddy，我会做更充分的准备。这是一份工作，我会提前练习。如果我做不到，我会请人来训练我。

> Corrections:

1. “would do” → 改为 “would have done” 是因为题干是假设过去情况，用虚拟语气（第三类条件句）
2. “so I would practice” → 改为 “I would have practiced” 以保持时态一致
3. “hire” → 改为 “would have hired” 同样是条件虚拟语气

If I were Eddy, I would have done better preparation. Since it’s a job, I would have practiced in advance. If I couldn’t do it, I would have hired someone to train me.

如果我是 Eddy，我本应该准备得更充分。既然这是份工作，我本来会提前练习。如果我做不到，我就会请人来训练我。

If I were Eddy, I would try to play the role as the director asked. After all, she is the boss. This is a job, do it as the boss asked is a basic.

> Corrections:

1. **“do it as the boss asked is a basic”** → 语法错误，句子结构不完整
   - 改为：**“doing what the boss asks is basic professionalism”**（表达更完整自然）
2. **“do it as the boss asked”**
   - → 更地道的表达是 **“doing what the boss asks”** 或 **“follow the director’s instructions”**

If I were Eddy, I would try to play the role as the director asked. After all, she is the boss. This is a job, and **doing** what the boss **asks** is basic **professionalism**.

If I were Eddy, I would **follow the director’s instructions** and do my **best** to **perform** the role as she requested. After all, she’s the boss, and **doing what your supervisor asks** is part of being **professional**.

如果我是 Eddy，我会按照导演的要求去演这个角色。毕竟她是老板，听从上级安排是最基本的职业素养。

If I were Eddy, I would **make** the same **choice**. I would try to do the job first, **and** if the **director** cannot accept it, then I would give up, but still **be** positive.

> Corrections:

1. **“would make”** → 应为 **“would have made”**，因为题干是虚拟语气（对过去情况的假设）。
2. **“director cannot accept”** → 时态应统一为虚拟语气过去形式：**“could not accept”**
3. **“be positive”** → 虽然语法没错，但更自然的表达是 **“stay positive”**

If I were Eddy, I **would have made** the same choice. I would try to do the job first, and if the **director** **could** not accept it, then I would give up — but still **stay** positive.

✨ 改写后亮点句型：

- **If I were Eddy, I would have made the same choice.**（典型虚拟语气结构）
- **stay positive**（表达“保持乐观”的自然口语搭配）
- **if the director could not accept it, then I would give up**（有条件让步逻辑）

如果我是 Eddy，我也会做出相同的选择。我会先尝试完成这项工作，如果导演不能接受，那我就放弃，但仍然保持积极乐观的态度。

> Corrections:

1. would try” → 应改为 “would have tried”：表示对过去的假设，统一使用虚拟语气（第三类条件句）
2. “could not” → “couldn’t” 缩写更自然
3. “stay positive” → 应为 “would have stayed positive” 保持时态一致

If I were Eddy, I **would have made** the same choice. I **would have tried** to do the job first, and if the director **couldn’t** accept it, then I would have given up — but I would **have stayed positive**.

如果我是 Eddy，我也会做出同样的选择。我会先尝试完成这份工作，如果导演不能接受，那我就放弃 — 但仍然会保持积极的心态。
