# Eddy for Mayor

Eddy is painting a big sign outside of his apartment building. Lucy walks by.

- **Eddy**: Hi Lucy! Will you help me put this sign on the wall?
- **Lucy**: Of course, Eddy!

Lucy looks at the sign.

- **Lucy**: It says, “Eddy for Mayor.”
- **Eddy**: Yes, exactly!
- **Lucy**: Why do you want to be the mayor of our city?
- **Eddy**: Because I don’t think **politicians** listen to regular people like us!
- **Lucy**: But Eddy, you don’t like politics.
- **Eddy**: No, but I like people!
  - And a good mayor should care about people.
- **Lucy**: Yes, that’s true. But a mayor also needs to know about town rules, and government, and laws.
- **Eddy**: Actually, Junior is studying politics. He told me that a lot of politicians don’t know the law at all!
- **Lucy**: I don’t think this is a good idea.
- **Eddy**: Why not?
- **Lucy**: Eddy, I go to every city meeting, and I’ve never seen you there.
- **Eddy**: Oh, I hate meetings.
- **Lucy**: Eddy, trust me. It’s a really hard job.
  - You’ll have to go to lots of meetings and talk to politicians all the time.
- **Eddy**: Ugh, I do not like politicians. I need someone to help me do that stuff.
  - Hey, you should be my **campaign** manager!
- **Lucy**: Me?
- **Eddy**: Yes! You know everyone, you care about the city, and you have great ideas!
- **Lucy**: Hmm… you’re right!
- **Eddy**: Really? So you’ll be my campaign manager?
- **Lucy**: Oh, definitely not.
- **Eddy**: Why not?
- **Lucy**: Because now I want to be the mayor.
