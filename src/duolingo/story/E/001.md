# Easy Parking - B3

From: bea@duomail.co

To: mary@duomail.co

**Subject: New Parking Garage Made for You!**

Hi Mary,

It's Bea, from right across the way! I heard from some colleagues that parking is nightmare for you. Well, worry no more!

I planned and helped construct a new parking garage in our neighborhood! According to my map, it's right near your building. Now, instead of getting lost and stressed, you can just drive in and park easily.

And have you seen the zones? There are special zones for pedestrians to keep you safe. I also set up bright signs to show you where to turn left and right. It's like a fun driving game! Just don't speed, or you might get a ticket!

I know you didn't ask for it, but I thought it would be an exciting surprise. Now, you won't have to leave home easly or get stuck in traffic. There can't be any more parking issues for you!

You're welcome!

Love,

Bea

### Practice History

**What are your thoughts on Bea's surprise?**

I think/ In my opinion, / Bea's surprise

I think Bea's surprise is so sweet. In my opinion, that's exactly what Mary **needs** and **has** solved her issue.

> Corrections:

1. "needs" 应改为 "needed"，因为描述的是过去的情境或问题。
   1. 用 needs（现在时） 的逻辑：
      1. 如果你说的是 Mary“现在”仍然需要这种关心或帮助，你就可以用现在时“needs”。
      2. 例如：Bea 的惊喜是一种长期支持，对 Mary 现在和将来都有帮助，那么用现在时没问题。
   2. 🔁 但这时，动词时态应该一致，而“has solved”是完成时，暗示已经发生并产生结果（→ 过去的事件）。这就造成了 时态不一致 的问题。
2. "has solved her issue" 前面缺主语，应补上 "it"（即“that surprise”）。

I think Bea's surprise is so sweet. In my opinion, that's exactly what Mary **needed** and it **has solved** her issue.

我觉得 Bea 的惊喜非常贴心。在我看来，那正是 Mary 所需要的，也确实解决了她的问题。

> Corrections:

1. “so sweet” → 改为 “really sweet” 更自然、地道（“so sweet”在正式表达中略显随意）
2. “that's exactly what Mary needed” → 应用过去时 “it was exactly…” 更符合语境时态
3. “it has solved her issue” → 改为 “it helped solve her problem” 更口语自然，语义清晰

I think Bea's surprise is **really sweet.** In my opinion, it was exactly what Mary needed — and it **helped** solve her problem.

我觉得 Bea 的惊喜真的很贴心。在我看来，那正是 Mary 所需要的 — 而且也确实帮她解决了问题。
