# Eddy's Night Out

Eddy puts on a tie. His son Junior watches.

- **Junior**: I'm so excited to stay at my friend's house tonight! But won't you be bored without me?
- **Eddy**: No, I'm going on a date!
  - It'll be nice to eat something **besides** pizza for dinner ... and to watch a serious movie instead of cartoons.
- **Junior**: That sounds boring.

Junior leaves. Eddy gets a text.

- **Eddy**: Oh no, my date is canceled!
  - Hmm, I still want to do something tonight.

A few minutes later, Eddy is at Oscar's house.

- **Eddy**: Thanks for inviting me to your house!
- **Oscar**: I didn't invite you here. You just came over.
  - But since you're already here, you can stay for a snack. I'm having cheese and **caviar**.
- **Junior**: Ooh, that sounds fancy!

Eddy tries some cheese.

- **Eddy**: Um, why does it ... smell so bad?
- **Oscar**: You don't like it? Try the caviar.

Eddy eats some caviar. He coughs and drinks some water.

- **Eddy**: Cough, cough! Wow, that... tastes like the ocean.
- **Oscar**: You hate it, don't you?
- **Eddy**: I hate it... so much.
- **Oscar**: Well, I'm going to paint now, so please leave.
- **Eddy**: OK, goodnight!

Eddy goes to Bea's apartment.

- **Eddy**: Hi, Bea! Do you want to do something?
- **Junior**: I'm going to a film festival. You should come!

They go to the movie theater.

- **Eddy**: What kind of movie are we watching? I hope it's a romantic comedy!
- **Bea**: It's an international art film.
- **Eddy**: That sounds interesting!
- **Bea**: It's about death, and it's four hours long!
- **Eddy**: Oh...

They sit and watch the film.

- **Bea**: Eddy, are you enjoying the movie?
  - Eddy?

Eddy has fallen asleep.

The next morning, Junior comes home.

- **Eddy**: Junior! You're home!
  - Let's watch cartoons and order pizza! Doesn't that sound fun?
- **Junior**: You were bored without me, weren't you?

## Writing

### Eddy had a busy night! What do you like to do in your free time?

**I like** doing things alone. Recently, I need to study, so I always feel I don't have enough time.

**I like** going on **the internet** to read some novels. Sometimes, I also go to the gym. **I find it** peaceful to be alone.

---

**I like** to watch some videos on the internet. And I also like reading some novels online. It's **relaxing**.

> Corrections:

1. **"I'm like to watch..."**
   - incorrect verb structure. It should be **"I like to watch..."**
2. "And I also like..."
   - grammatically okay, but starting with "And" is informal and could be improved for smoother flow.

**I like to** watch some videos on the internet in my free time. **I also enjoy** reading novels online **â€”** it's relaxing.
