# Eddy's Cooking Tips

Hello Dear Reader,

I'm Chef Eddy. Technically, I don't have any restaurant experience, but I took a cooking class after my son said he was tired of eating burned food. I guess that makes me a chef!

Anyway, if you're cooking for a date, just follow my tips. If I can do it, so can you!

**Cook Multiple Dishes**

Rather than cooking one dish, cook five! This way, if four of them taste horrible, one of them will probably taste acceptable.

You'll also have plenty of leftovers, so if you have a second date the same week, you don't have to worry about cooking. You can just serve your date the leftovers!

Or more likely, you can eat them alone.

**Set the Mood**

Before your date arrives, you should set the mood by chilling some wine and lighting candles. Everything looks better in candlelight, which is almost like no light at all!

And if the candles start a fire, you can use the wine to put it out.

**Ask about Allergies**

Last but not least, always remember to ask about allergies before cooking anything. If you don't, you could ruin the entire night by giving your date a serious allergic reaction.

I know from personal experience that if a first date ends at the hospital, it won't lead to a second date.

Just follow these tips, and you'll be impressing your dates like Chef Eddy in no time!
