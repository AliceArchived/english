# Embracing Gray - B3

Bea and Eddy are sitting in Bea's living room. Bea picks up a mirror to fix her hair. Suddenly, she freezes.

- **Bea**: Oh no… no, no, no!

Bea leans closer to the mirror, wide-eyed.

- **Eddy**: Bea, are you OK? You look like you saw a ghost.
- **Bea**: Worse! I found my first gray hair!
- **Eddy**: That's it? Bea, that's not scary. It's just a gray hair.
- **Bea**: Not scary? Eddy, this is a personal nightmare!

Eddy **squints** at his phone, trying to read a text message.

- **Bea**: Wait… why are you squinting like that?
- **Eddy**: Huh? Oh, no reason. The text just… looks smaller today.
- **Bea**: Eddy, have you considered getting reading glasses?
- **Eddy**: Glasses? No way! Glasses are for old people.
- **Bea**: Um, Eddy, you're squinting harder than someone lost in the mountains.
- **Eddy**: OK, fine. Maybe I could try glasses. But only if you help me pick them.
- **Bea**: Deal. And you help me embrace my "graceful aging."
- **Eddy**: Graceful aging? What does that mean?
- **Bea**: A **makeover**! I want to look… mature but stylish!
- **Eddy**: Oh, I can help with that. You know, when I was your age, my coach always said, "Look good, feel good. Go get 'em, tiger!"

Eddy smiles proudly. Bea rolls her eyes but laughs.

- **Bea**: Let's just start with the glasses, Eddy.
- **Eddy**: Sure, but don't forget — if they give me a discount for being old, that's my treat!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why does Eddy need glasses?**

Eddy needs glasses because he’s starting to have difficulty reading small text, especially on his phone. Over time, the text messages appear smaller to him — not because they’ve changed, but because his **eyesight** has. This is a common part of **aging**, and Eddy is simply experiencing what many people do as they get older. It's not a big deal, but it does mean he needs a little help seeing clearly, which is why he decides to get glasses.

Eddy 需要眼镜是因为他开始难以阅读手机上的小字。随着时间的推移，短信在他看来变得更小——并不是字体真的变了，而是他的视力发生了变化。这是衰老过程中常见的现象，Eddy 只是经历了很多人都会遇到的事情。这并不是什么大问题，但确实意味着他需要一些帮助来看得更清楚，这就是他决定配眼镜的原因。

### Practice History

**Why does Eddy need glasses?**

Helpful Phrases: Eddy needs/ because/ smaller

Eddy needs glasses because the text messages are smaller than he used to feel. ~~Acutally~~ he becomes older.

> Corrections:

1. “than he used to feel” is ungrammatical; it should be “than they used to” (referring to the text).
2. “Acutally” is a typo, should be “Actually”.
3. “he becomes older” is grammatically **awkward** here; “he's **getting older**” is more natural in context.

Eddy needs glasses because the text messages **look** smaller than **they** used to. Actually, **it’s because** he's **getting older**.

Eddy 需要眼镜是因为短信的字体比以前看起来更小了。其实，这是因为他年纪大了。
