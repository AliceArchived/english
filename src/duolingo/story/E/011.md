# Eddy's Parenting Book - B2

Eddy walks into his son Junior's bedroom, stepping over piles of toys and clothes.

- **Eddy**: Look at this mess, Junior! According to the parenting book I've been reading, it's very important for children to clean their rooms. It's the first step to **being** successful in life.
- **Junior**: Why do you care about what a book says?
- **Eddy**: The author was a tough parent, and his daughter grew up to cure two diseases. Most people never even cure one!
  - That's why I'm going to be in charge from now on, Junior.
- **Junior**: I'll make my bed if you get us pizza for dinner.

Eddy opens his parenting book.

- **Eddy**: The book doesn't say anything about pizza, so I guess that's OK.
- **Junior**: And I'll clean the whole room if we can get ice cream afterward.
- **Eddy**: Alright. I want ice cream too, so I'm technically still in charge of this situation.

Eddy turns to another chapter in his book.

- **Eddy**: The book also says that it's important for you to help with chores.
  - So please take out the trash.
- **Junior**: Hmm ... I'll do it if I can make a pond with dirt and rocks for my pet frog.
- **Eddy**: Junior, we've talked about this. No more ponds in the bathtub.
- **Junior**: Fine then, I won't take out the trash.

Eddy desperately looks through the book.

- **Eddy**: Oh no, the book definitely doesn't say anything about frogs!
- **Junior**: Then we have a deal!

An hour later, Eddy brings Junior pizza and ice cream while Junior's frog swims in the dirt-filled bathtub.

- **Junior**: Thanks, Dad! You did everything I asked.
- **Eddy**: I was supposed to be in charge. How did this happen?
- **Junior**: When you got that book on parenting at the library, I also got a book. It's about how to persuade people.

**Why did Eddy agree to buy pizza?**

Eddy agreed / because / parenting book

Eddy agreed to buy pizza because the parenting book didn’t give any **guidance** on that situation. Junior **cleverly** used this **gap** to negotiate — when Eddy asked him to do chores, Junior made a deal to get pizza in return, and Eddy eventually agreed.

Eddy 同意买披萨是因为育儿书上并没有提到这种情况。Junior 很聪明，他利用了这个漏洞来谈条件——当 Eddy 让他做家务时，他提出用披萨作为交换，最后 Eddy 答应了。

### Practice History

**Why did Eddy agree to buy pizza?**

Eddy agreed / because / parenting book

Eddy agreed to buy pizza because the parenting book didn’t say anything about pizza. Junior was smart—when Eddy asked him to do chores, he bargained for pizza, and Eddy gave in.

“gave in” means: To finally agree to something after initially resisting or saying no.

Eddy initially didn’t want to, but finally agreed because Junior persuaded him.

| Phrase      | Meaning                                          | Emotion/Context                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Agreed**  | Simply accepted something                        | Neutral                               |
| **Gave in** | Accepted after pressure/persuasion or hesitation | Suggests some resistance was overcome |

So “gave in” is **more vivid**, showing Junior was clever and persuasive.
