# Eddy Gets an Offer

Eddy is shopping in the supermarket when he feels an urgent tap on his shoulder. He turns around to see a woman wearing large sunglasses.

- **Woman**: Wow, you are truly amazing!

Eddy is surprised by the **compliment**. He turns to make sure there isn't another man behind him, but no one is there.

- **Eddy**: Me? Amazing?
- **Woman**: I work on TV commercials, and I think you'd be perfect for something we're shooting.
  - Do you have any acting experience?
- **Eddy**: Actually, I was the star of a school play when I was younger! I played a tree.
- **Woman**: Hmm, OK ... Can you hold up that apple for me?

Eddy awkwardly holds up an apple.

- **Woman**: On second thought, I don't think you're right for the role, but it was nice meeting you.
- **Eddy**: Wait! What if I try something different?

Eddy jumps, lands on one knee, and gazes at the apple as if that one piece of fruit contained all his hopes and dreams.

- **Woman**: Better, but I'm still not convinced. Can you try holding some toilet paper instead?

Eddy takes a deep breath as he tears open a large pack of toilet paper. He grabs a few rolls and starts juggling them. The toilet paper flies everywhere.

- **Eddy**: What do you think?
- **Woman**: Bravo! We're filming a toilet paper commercial in Vancouver. Are you able to be on set next weekend?
- **Eddy**: Absolutely!

As the woman leaves, a store employee walks over to Eddy.

- **Eddy** : Can you believe it? I got a part in a commercial!
- **Employee**: Congrats. You still need to buy all that toilet paper on the floor.

## Writing

### Would you act in a TV commercial? Why or why not?

No, I would rather not act in a TV commercial. To become famous is a burden for me. In today's reality, if anyone **gets** famous, all their life details will be discussed by other people and I don't think I am strong enough to suffer this.

> Corrections:

1. “To become famous is a burden for me.”
   - grammatically okay, but more natural phrasing:
   - “Becoming famous is a burden for me.”
2. “if anyone **gets** famous”
   - better as “if someone **becomes** famous” for smoother tone.
3. “to suffer this”
   - “to **handle** this” or “to **go through** this” would sound more natural in this context.

No, I would rather not act in a TV commercial. **Becoming** famous is a burden for me. In today's reality, if someone **becomes** famous, all their life details will be discussed by other people, and I don't think I am strong enough to **handle** that.
