# Eddy's Tears

Vikram is **stirring** a pot of soup **at the stove** while his friend Eddy cuts vegetables next to him.

- **Vikram**: How was your date with Mira last night?
- **Eddy**: I thought it was amazing, but now I don't know. I think she might break up with me.

Eddy gives Vikram a bowl of carrots. Vikram adds them to the pot.

- **Vikram**: Really? What did she say?
- **Eddy**: She wants me to be more sensitive.
- **Vikram**: Oh, you can definitely do that! **Cut this into slices**, please.

Vikram gives Eddy a potato.

- **Eddy**: I'm trying to be more sensitive, but it's very hard.
- **Vikram**: Have you tried **writing** in a **journal**?
- **Eddy**: Yes, I did!
- **Vikram**: How was it?
- **Eddy**: I fell asleep.
- **Vikram**: Hmm, OK. Have you tried talking to a **therapist**?

Eddy gives Vikram a bowl of potatoes. Vikram adds them to the pot.

- **Eddy**: Yes, I did.
- **Vikram**: And?
- **Eddy**: The therapist fell asleep.
- **Vikram**: I see. Can you cut these onions?
- **Eddy**: Sure. I really like Mira. I don't want her to break up with me.

Eddy's eyes begin to fill with tears.

- **Vikram**: Eddy! Look at you! You're being more sensitive!

Eddy wipes the tears out of his eyes.

- **Vikram**: You just need to talk about how you feel more often!
- **Eddy**: No, I think I just need to cut onions when I'm with Mira!

Eddy puts two onions in his pocket.

- **Eddy**: Can I keep these?

## Writing

### What advice would you give Eddy? Why?

I would tell Eddy **to** find someone they both feel comfortable **with**. If Mira thinks Eddy isn't sensitive enough, and Eddy tried different ways and still failed to solve the problem, then Eddy should let this relationship to. For **long-term** **relationships**, it's better to be himself.

> Corrections:

1. “they both feel comfortable with”
   - → unclear if Mira is still relevant. Changed to “he feels truly comfortable with” to match your intent.
2. “then Eddy should let this relationship to”
   - → incorrect structure. Should be “let this relationship go.”
3. “Eddy tried different ways”
   - → past perfect “has tried” is better for recent but unresolved attempts.
4. “For long-term relationships”
   - → better phrased as “In a long-term relationship” for flow.

I would tell Eddy to find someone **he feels truly comfortable with**. If Mira thinks Eddy isn't sensitive enough, and Eddy has tried different ways but still failed to solve the problem, then **he** should let this relationship go. In **a long-term relationship**, it’s better to be himself.

我会建议 Eddy 找一个他真正觉得舒服自在的人。如果 Mira 觉得 Eddy 不够敏感，而 Eddy 已经尝试了各种方法却仍然无法解决问题，那他就应该放手这段关系。在一段长期关系中，做自己才是最重要的。

I would tell Eddy he can find someone **who** doesn't care about his **personality**. As an adult, it is difficult to change **ourselves** or other people, so just filter.

> Corrections:

1. “someone who doesn’t care about his personality”
   - might be better phrased as **“someone who accepts him as he is”** (more natural and positive).
2. “so just filter”
   - too informal and vague; could be clearer, e.g.,
   - **“so it’s better to focus on finding the right match instead of trying to change”**.

I would tell Eddy that he can find **someone who accepts him as he is**. As **adults**, it’s difficult to change **ourselves** or **others**, so it’s better to focus on finding **the right match** **instead of** trying to change anyone.
