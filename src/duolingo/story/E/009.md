# Eddy's Dating Profile - B2

**About me**

Hi, I'm Eddy, a single dad and a fun guy. I like to hike, eat pizza, and work out - sometimes all at the same time!

If I look familiar, it's probably because you've seen me on all the other dating apps. :)

**The thing I'm most proud of**

I once ran a mile in four minutes after eating **thirty** hot dogs. My son Junior didn't believe that I could do it, so I wanted to prove him wrong.

So, essentially, I'm most proud of my son, Junior, who pushes me to be a better version of myself.

**How my friends and family describe me**

- **Bea**: In my opinion, he probably wouldn't be single if he'd just stop wearing **tracksuits** and **sweatbands** all the time.
- **Junior**: You can get him to do anything if you **dare** him to do it!
- **Oscar**: Eddy is… my co-worker.

**My secret talent is**

**Optimism**! In the past, if a woman didn't call me back after a first date I always felt **devastated**.

But now, I always hope that my dates will call back eventually — no matter how badly the first date went. My friends call this "unrealistic" and "**deluded**," but I prefer to call it "**optimistic**"!

**If I were extremely rich**

I would solve world hunger!

Also, I would replace all the stairs in my apartment building with waterslides.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Will Eddy find a date based on his dating profile? Why or why not?**

To me, **it doesn’t look like** Eddy will find a date using his current profile. He has already met a few women, but none of those meetings turned into anything meaningful. He describes his attitude as optimistic, but his friends say it’s unrealistic — and honestly, I can **see their point**.

在我看来，Eddy 靠他现在的简介不太可能找到理想的对象。他已经见过几位女士，但都没有真正发展下去。他自己说这是乐观的态度，但朋友们觉得这太不现实了 — 说实话，我能理解他们的看法。

### Practice History

**Will Eddy find a date based on his dating profile? Why or why not?**

It seems to me that Eddy won't find a date based on his dating profile. He met some women, but didn't have a result. He calls it optimistic and his friends call it unrealistic.

> Corrections:

1.  He calls it optimistic → 改为 “he calls that optimistic”（指未放弃希望这件事）
2.  “didn't have a result” → 改为 “nothing has worked out so far” 更口语地道

It seems to me that Eddy won’t find a date based on his dating profile. He has met **a few women**, but **nothing has worked out so far**. He calls **that** optimistic — but his friends think he’s just being unrealistic.

在我看来，Eddy 靠他的交友简介很难找到约会对象。他虽然见过一些女生，但都没有结果。他称自己这种态度是乐观的，但朋友们觉得这根本不现实。
