# Eddy's New Haircut

Eddy sees Lucy outside their apartment building.

- **Lucy**: Whoa, Eddy! What happened to your hair?
- **Eddy**: Oh, I got a new haircut!
- **Lucy**: Well, you need to fix it.
  - Can you go to a hairstylist?
- **Eddy**: No, I have a date right now...
  - Oh no!
  - This is really bad!
- **Lucy**: Actually, maybe the haircut is OK ...
  - Turn your head to the right.

Eddy turns his head. Lucy looks closely.

- **Lucy**: No. Turn your head the other way.

Eddy turns his head the other way.

- **Lucy**: No, sorry, it looks bad from every angle.
  - I hope you can get your money back from your hairstylist.
- **Eddy**: It was free.
- **Lucy**: Someone should tell your hairstylist to find a new career.
- **Eddy**: You just told him.
- **Lucy**: What?
- **Eddy**: I cut my own hair.
  - I watched a video on the Internet.
  - It looked easy.
- **Lucy**: Eddy, you have to cancel your date.
- **Eddy**: It's OK. I brought my favorite hat!

Eddy puts on his hat. Lucy looks worried.

- **Eddy**: What's wrong now?
- **Lucy**: Uh ... well...
  - Do you have a different hat?
- **Eddy**: Why?
- **Lucy**: That hat is worse than the haircut.
