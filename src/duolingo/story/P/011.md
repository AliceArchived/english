# Positive Thinking - B2

Before school, Zari is smiling as she joins her best friend, Lily, at their lockers.

- **Zari**: What a great day!
- **Lily**: Is it?
- **Zari**: It is if you decide it is!

Zari holds up a book.

- **Zari**: This book is all about the science of positive thinking. It says that positive thoughts lead to positive things happening in your life.
- **Lily**: That doesn't sound very scientific.
- **Zari**: I'm going to think positive thoughts about my audition for the school play this afternoon. Troy is the lead actor. He's so cute!

Zari opens her locker door. Books and papers spill everywhere.

- **Lily**: Great start.
- **Zari**: That's OK. I'm being positive.

Zari bends down to pick up her things. When she stands and turns, she bumps into a classmate, who accidentally spills soda all over Zari's shirt.

- **Classmate**: Sorry, Zari! I'll find something to clean that up.
- **Zari**: That's OK.
- **Lily**: Does your book mention stained shirts?
- **Zari**: Very funny, but I'm staying positive.

As Zari closes her locker, she takes a step backward, slips on the wet floor, and falls down.

- **Zari**: Ouch! My **ankle**!

Lily helps Zari stand up.

- **Lily**: Are you OK?
- **Zari**: I don't understand why things keep going wrong! I've been thinking positive thoughts all morning.
  - Maybe you were right about this book.

Just then, Troy runs over to them.

- **Troy**: Zari, are you hurt? That looked bad.
- **Zari**: I think I **sprained** my ankel.
- **Troy**: I'll take you to the nurse's office.
- **Zari**: Really?

Troy lifts Zari into his arms as Lily watches with a surprised look on her face. Zari holds Troy tightly and smiles at Lily over his shoulder.

- **Zari**: See you later, Lily!

Lily picks up Zari's book from the floor.

- **Lily**: Maybe I should read this.

### What do you think about the book's advice? Would you follow it? Why or why not?

In my opinion, keeping positive is necessary. It is not necessary bring good things happen, but ~~sure~~ it will keeps one in good condition until good things happen.

In my opinion, keeping positive is necessary. It is not necessary **to** bring good things **to** happen, but it will **surely keep** one in good condition until good things happen.

1. **"It is not necessary to bring good things to happen"** – grammatically incorrect and unclear. The intention seems to be: “It may not cause good things to happen.”
2. **"surely keep one in good condition"** – slightly awkward phrasing. “In good condition” sounds physical; for mood or mindset, better to say “in a good state of mind” or “mentally strong.”

In my opinion, keeping positive is necessary. It may not necessarily **make good things happen**, but it will surely **help one stay in a good state of mind** until they do.

In my opinion, ~~keep~~ positive helps. Life is not easy, if we can't ~~positive~~, we can't ~~insist~~ doing things, if we give up, we can't wait until things succeed. And a lot of things just need to ~~keep~~ doing ~~and~~ finally it will succeed.

In my opinion, **keeping** positive helps. Life is not easy. **If** we can't **be** positive, we can't **insist on** doing things. **If** we give up, we can't wait until things succeed. And a lot of things just need to **be kept** doing **until they** finally succeed.

1. "insist on doing things" sounds unnatural; better to say "keep doing things" or "persevere."
2. "be kept doing" is grammatically incorrect; should be "keep being done" or "be kept up."
3. Repetition of "if" makes the flow awkward; combining or rephrasing helps.

In my opinion, **staying positive helps**. Life is not easy. **If we can't stay positive, we won't be able to keep going.** **If we give up, we won’t see success.**
A lot of things just need to **be done consistently until they finally succeed**.
