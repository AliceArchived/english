# Pirate Land

Zari and Lily are at an amusement park.

- **Zari**: Isn't Pirate Land the best?
- **Lily**: No.
- **Zari**: What do you want to do now? Go on the pirate ship? Visit the gift shop?
- **Lily**: I want to go home and sleep.
- **Zari**: We can't go until I find Paul. He works here. He got us these tickets to the park!
- **Lily**: Then let's find him quickly. This park is stupid. Real pirates never sang and danced together.
- **Zari**: Real pirates also never ate **nachos**, but you didn't complain when I bought you some.
- **Lily**: Yes, but they're delicious. Do you want some?

Just then, Zari sees Paul.

- **Zari**: There he is! Isn't he cute in that pirate costume?
- **Lily**: He looks ridiculous. He has a parrot on his shoulder.
- **Zari**: Oh no. I'm terrified of parrots!
- **Lily**: You came here to talk to Paul. Just talk to him.

Zari and Lily walk over to Paul.

- **Zari**: Hi, Paul!
- **Paul**: Hi, Zari! Wow, umm... it's great to see you!
- **Parrot**: **Squawk**! Go away!

Zari shouts and jumps back.

- **Paul**: I'm so sorry! Parrots don't understand what they're saying.
- **Zari**: Oh... OK.
- **Paul**: I wanted to tell you something, Zari...
- **Parrot**: Squawk! You're ugly!
- **Zari**: I'm ugly?!
- **Paul**: No! That's the parrot talking! I think you look great!
  - Zari, I wanted to ask you a question.
- **Zari**: Yes?

Suddenly, the parrot flies off Paul's shoulder and lands in Lily's nachos.

- **Lily**: My nachos!
- **Zari**: Oh no! It's attacking us!

Zari screams and runs away.

- **Paul**: Zari! Wait!

A few minutes later, Lily finds Zari next to the pirate ship.

- **Lily**: That was hilarious.
- **Zari**: I'm so embarrassed. We have to leave now.
- **Lily**: No way, Pirate Land is great. And I need some more nachos.

## Writing

### What is your favorite part of the story? Why?

I love the part **where** Zari is expecting Paul to say something, but because of the parrot, Paul can't even have a chance to say anything.

我最喜欢的部分是 Zari 正期待 Paul 说话，但因为鹦鹉的缘故，Paul 连开口的机会都没有。

I love the part when Zari is waiting for Paul to say something important, but the parrot keeps interrupting and ruins the moment. It's both funny and frustrating, and it shows how chaotic things can get at Pirate Land.

我最喜欢的部分是 Zari 等着 Paul 说重要的话时，那只鹦鹉却不断打断，搞砸了整个场面。这一幕既搞笑又让人抓狂，也体现出海盗乐园的混乱和意外。

**My favorite part is when Zari is hoping Paul will finally say something sweet, but the parrot just won’t shut up! Poor Paul doesn’t even get a chance — it’s like the bird is his worst wingman.**
我最喜欢的是 Zari 希望 Paul 说点甜蜜的话，结果那只鹦鹉一直插话，根本停不下来！可怜的 Paul 连开口的机会都没有，简直像带了个最糟糕的“翅膀队友”。

**My favorite part is when Zari is all ready for a sweet moment with Paul, but the parrot totally steals the show—squawking nonsense and ruining everything. Poor Paul doesn’t even get a word in! It’s so ridiculous that I couldn’t stop laughing.**
我最喜欢的是 Zari 准备和 Paul 来一段甜蜜对话时，那只鹦鹉突然抢戏——不停乱叫，把气氛全搞砸了。可怜的 Paul 连话都插不上！这场面太荒唐了，笑死我了。

**“Wingman”** 原本是军事术语，指飞行编队中在侧翼护航的战斗机飞行员；但在日常英语中，它更常用作俚语，意思如下：

A **wingman** is a friend who supports you—especially when you're trying to talk to someone you like (e.g., in romantic or social situations).

### 常见用法例句：

- _Lily was the perfect wingman—she distracted the parrot so Zari could talk to Paul._
- _I need a good wingman at this party. Help me talk to that guy._
