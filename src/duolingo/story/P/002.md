# Pasta Problem

Bea is eating pasta at a restaurant in Rome. A waiter walks past her table.

- **Bea**: Excuse me! There’s a problem with my pasta.
- **Waiter**: That’s not possible. That’s our most popular dish!
- **Bea**: Did the recipe change?
- **Waiter**: No! Our recipe hasn’t changed **in** fifty years!
- **Bea**: Well, I ate this pasta here seven years ago, and now it tastes different.
- **Waiter**: Seven years is a long time. Maybe you’re different.
- **Bea**: Hmm… I was younger then. Everything was new and exciting.
- **Waiter**: OK…
- **Bea**: I’m a lot more serious now.
  - But I’m also more responsible and intelligent.
  - You’re right. I’ve changed a lot! Thanks!
- **Waiter**: You’re welcome.
- **Bea**: What happened to the waiter who worked here seven years ago?
  - He had sunglasses and a **mustache**.
- **Waiter**: That’s Antonio.
- **Bea**: Does he still work here?
- **Waiter**: No, he never **worked** here.
  - He **works** at the restaurant across the street.
- **Bea**: Oh…

**Later, Bea is eating the same pasta dish in the restaurant across the street.**

- **Bea**: Yeah, this tastes exactly the same.
  - That’s sad. Maybe I haven’t changed.
