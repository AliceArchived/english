# Pirate Post - B2

Dear Junior,

Thank you for subscribing to **Pirate Post**, the official newsletter for Pirate Land! Here are the latest updates on what's going on at our amusement park this month!

Our **mascot**, Pete the Parrot, has recently taken behavioral classes to stop saying inappropriate things. (british: behavioural)

From now on, when Pete's performing his duties (such as taking pictures with guests and helping with marriage proposals), he will no longer be sharing his **controversial** political opinions.

Speaking of improvements, don't miss out on our newly reopened roller coaster, the Death Express! The ride was closed last year after a minor accident (no one died), but now it's back!

After **signing** a short, 50-page legal document, you can ride down the tracks at a speed that our lawyers have said we should not reveal to our visitors!

So **come on down** and see why every day at Pirate Land is as fun as finding hidden treasure!

## Vocabulary

- Reveal to: 透露给

## Sentences

- 所以快来看看，为什么在海盗乐园的每一天都像发现隐藏的宝藏一样有趣吧！
  - So **come on down** and see why every day at Pirate Land is as fun as finding hidden treasure!
  - "come on down" is an informal, friendly invitation that means: 👉 "Come and visit us!" or "Come here and join the fun!"

## Writing

### Would you ride the Death Express at Pirate Land? Why or why not?

After reading the newsletter, I would not ride the Death Express at ~~the~~ Pirate Land. It seems there are lots of issues they didn't reveal.

> Corrections:

1. "at the Pirate Land"
   - → "at Pirate Land" is more natural; the article "the" is unnecessary before a proper name.
2. "It seems there are lots of issues they didn't reveal."
   - → clearer phrasing would be: "It seems like there are a lot of issues they didn’t mention."

After reading the newsletter, I would not ride the Death Express at Pirate Land. It seems like there are a lot of issues they didn’t mention.

读完这份简报后，我不会去坐海盗乐园的“死亡快车”。感觉他们有很多问题没有说明。

### Polished

No, I wouldn’t ride the Death Express. **Even though** it has reopened, the **newsletter** says there was a past accident and jokes about signing **a 50-page legal document**. That makes me think it might still be unsafe, and the park **isn't being completely honest** about the risks.

我不会去坐“死亡快车”。虽然它重新开放了，但简报提到之前发生过事故，还开玩笑说要签一份 50 页的法律文件。这让我觉得它可能仍然不安全，而且乐园对风险并不完全坦诚。
