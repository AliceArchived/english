# Painting at Sunrise

Lin is painting in Oscar's studio.

- **Lin**: Ugh… My painting is boring.
- **Oscar**: Well, sometimes you just need inspiration… and great light.

Oscar points outside.

- **Oscar**: There's an amazing view from the mountain. Go there at sunrise.
- **Lin**: Sunrise? I hate waking up early!
- **Oscar**: You have to. The light at sunrise is perfect.
- **Lin**: I hope the view is worth it.

The next morning, Lin hikes up the mountain with her paint, canvas, and **easel**.

She meets a hiker on the trail.

- **Hiker**: Wow, that looks heavy! How far are you hiking?
- **Lin**: I'm going to the top of the mountain.
- **Hiker**: That's three miles!
- **Lin**: What?

Two hours later, Lin arrives at the top and sets up her easel.

- **Lin**: Ugh, I'm exhausted. But the light here is perfect!

As she picks up her **paintbrush**, a family sets up a picnic in front of her.

- **Lin**: Excuse me! I'm trying to paint.
- **Man**: Oh, we'll only be here for a few minutes! Would you like a sandwich?
- **Lin**: No, thanks. I need to paint before the sunrise is over.

Lin moves her easel to a new place. Just then, a bus full of tourists arrives.

- **Lin**: Hey! I'm trying to paint! Can you move?
- **Man**: Sure, as soon as we get some pictures!

The tourists all begin to take pictures.

- **Lin**: Ugh! The sunrise is gone!

Lin angrily throws her brushes at the canvas.

- **Lin**: I quit!

Lin hikes back down the mountain and returns to Oscar's studio.

- **Lin**: Here's your easel, Oscar.
- **Oscar**: How did your painting go this morning?
- **Lin**: Not good.

Lin shows Oscar the painting.

- **Oscar**: You threw paint all over the canvas?
- **Lin**: Yes, I did.
- **Oscar**: It's… magnificent! I love it!
