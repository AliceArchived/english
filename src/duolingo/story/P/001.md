# Paper Towels, Watch, Pens - B3

Lin, Joined 2009

Items Sold: 512

I'm back with more treasures from my apartment! Today, I found some things that need a new home. If you like paper towels, old watches, or packs of pens, you're in luck. This is what I have today:

**Roll of Paper Towels - 2 dollars**

Here we have a roll of paper towels. I found it under the kitchen sink. It's perfect for cleaning up spills, wiping hands, or making a paper towel sculpture. Who doesn't want a paper towel sculpture?

**Old Watch - 5 dollars**

This is an old watch I found in the drawer. I think it belonged to my grandmother Lucy. It's not the latest fashion, but it works! It tells time and tells stories, probably. Just don't ask it what time it is in space.

**A Pack of Pens - 3 dollars**

I found a pack of pens behind the couch. I probably threw them out there ages ago. There are five pens. They all work! You can use them to write your own to-do list or **doodle** all over it. I promise I won't judge.

That's all I have!

Call, text, or email me!

  - “Who wouldn’t want a sculpture made of something as exciting as... paper towels?” 😄
  - → That’s the joke — it’s funny because it’s over-the-top for a boring item.
- 这是我在抽屉里发现的一块旧手表。我想它以前是我祖母 Lucy 的。它不是最新款式，但还能用！它不仅能报时，可能还能讲故事。只是别问它太空现在几点。

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Which item seems most useful to you? Why?**

I think the most useful item among the three is the pack of pens. To be honest, none of the options are extremely useful for me, but **if I had to make a choice**, I’d definitely **go with the pens**. The paper towels seem a bit risky because they’re old and might carry germs, especially in times like these when hygiene is important. As for the watch, I already rely on my phone to check the time. So **practically speaking**, the pens are the safest and most useful option.

我认为这三样物品中最有用的是那一包笔。说实话，这些选项对我来说都不是特别实用，但如果非要选一个，我肯定会选笔。旧纸巾看起来有些不卫生，可能携带细菌，尤其是在现在这个非常注重卫生的时期。至于手表，我平时已经习惯用手机看时间了。所以从实际角度来说，笔是最安全也最实用的选择。

### Practice History

**Which item seems most useful to you? Why?**

Helpful Phrases: I think/ For me/ The most useful is

I think the most useful item for me is the pack of pens. Actually, **none** of them are that useful for me. But if I must have to choose one, I'd choose the pen. For me, I **am** concerned about the virus **on** the old paper towel, and I have **my** phone to check **the** time, so the pen is the only choice.

> Corrections:

1. “must have to” → redundant; use either "must" or "have to", not both.
2. “am concerned about the virus on the old paper towel” → better as “concerned about the virus that might be on the old paper towels” for fluency and accuracy.
3. “the pen is the only choice” → improve tone and naturalness: “only practical option”.
4. “on the old paper towel” → changed to plural “paper towels” to match the original story.
5. Prefer consistent plural for “pens” instead of “the pen”, as the item offered is a pack.

I think the most useful item for me is the pack of pens. Actually, **none** of them are **particularly** useful **to** me, but if **I have to choose one**, I'd choose the **pens**. **I’m** concerned about the virus that might be **on** the old paper towels, and I **can already** check the time using my phone — so the pens are my only **practical option**.

我认为对我来说最有用的物品是一包笔。实际上，它们对我来说都不是特别有用。但如果我必须选择一个，我会选笔。我担心旧纸巾上可能有病毒，而且我已经可以用手机看时间了——所以笔是我唯一实际可用的选项。
