# Planting Watermelons - B3

Eddy is out in the backyard, digging in the vegetable garden.

Junior runs outside, looking excited.

- **Junior**: Dad! What are you doing?
- **Eddy**: I'm planting vegetables, Junior. You never used to care about this stuff.
- **Junior**: Well, I care now! I want to help!
- **Eddy**: Really? You want to garden? This is… amazing!
- **Junior**: Yes! Gardening is cool. Let's plant something fun!
- **Eddy**: Fun? Growing vegetables is about healthy food, not fun.
- **Junior**: But healthy food can be fun! What are we planting?
- **Eddy**: Carrots, tomatoes, **lettuce**.
- **Junior**: Hmm… Boring. Let's plant watermelons!
- **Eddy**: Watermelons? That's… different. Why watermelons?
- **Junior**: Because I read they're fun to grow. And tasty too!
- **Eddy**: Okay… I guess we can plant a few watermelons.

Eddy grabs a seed packet. Junior watches closely.

- **Eddy**: First, we measure the space for the seeds.
- **Junior**: Measure? This seems like a lot of work…
- **Eddy**: Gardening takes work, Junior. You have to water and take care of the plants.
- **Junior**: Hmm… How long until the watermelons are ready?
- **Eddy**: A few months.
- **Junior**: Months?! I can't wait that long, Dad!
- **Eddy**: Why are you in such a hurry, Junior?

Junior sighs.

- **Junior**: Fine, I'll tell you. I saw a video online. You can turn watermelons into candy bowls!
- **Eddy**: Candy bowls? So this isn't about gardening at all!
- **Junior**: Gardening is fun… but candy bowls are better!
- **Eddy**: Junior, I can't get over how much you love candy.
- **Junior**: It's a talent, Dad. A sweet, sweet talent!

### Practice History

**Why did Junior want to plant watermelons?**

Junior wanted/ because he/ candy bowls

Junior wanted to plant watermelon because he watched a video **which** said watermelons can be used to make candy bowls.

> Corrections:

1. “watermelon” 应为复数形式 **“watermelons”**，因为是泛指想种植多颗西瓜。

Junior wanted to plant watermelons because he watched a video which said watermelons can be used to make candy bowls.

Junior 想种西瓜，因为他看了一个视频，视频说西瓜可以用来做糖果碗。

### “which” vs “that” 的区别：

|            | **which**                    | **that**               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 类型       | 更正式，偏书面语             | 更口语、自然常见       |
| 用法       | 引导限定性或非限定性定语从句 | 通常用于限定性定语从句 |
| 是否可省略 | 不可省略（在主语位置）       | 有时可以省略           |

> Corrections:

1. “watched a video which said” → 更自然地表达是 “saw a video that said” （口语中更常用 “saw” 来指偶然看到视频）
2. “can be used” 保留，但因原句主语是复数 “watermelons”，所以使用 “they can be used”
3. “which” → 改为 “that” 更口语自然，用于限定性从句更合适

Junior wanted to plant watermelons because he **saw** a video **that** said they can be used to make candy bowls.

Junior 想种西瓜，是因为他看到一个视频，说西瓜可以用来做糖果碗。
