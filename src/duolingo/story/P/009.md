# Playing Archeologist Together - B3

Eddy's Advice Column

Hello, friends!

I'm Eddy. today, the question is, 'How can I pretend to be an archeologist with my my kids?' You're in the right place! I've got some fun tips for you… and I'm **convinced** they'll work because Junior and I do this on weekends! Here's what you can do:

**Build Your Own Pyramids**

Use blocks, pillows, or even piles of laundry! Build the most impressive ones right there in your living room.

Imagine you'are in Egypt, studying ancient wonders. Junior's pyramids can almost look like the real thing, but they tend to fall apart quickly!

Dig for Ruins in Your Backyard

Grab some small tools, like spoons, and dig for treasures! You might find rocks, bugs, or old toys. Suppose you discover a hidden city buried below your lawn! Junior once found an old keychain and swears it's from an ancient world.

**Tell Alien Stories**

**For the sake of fun**, let's say aliens helped build the pyramids. What a coincidence! You can swap **wild theories** with you kids. Junior loves the idea of UFOs and spaceships flying around. These stories turned out to be a great way to spark imagination.

With my fun tricks, you and your kids can be archeologists for a day!

Stay strong!

你好，朋友们！

我是 Eddy。今天的问题是：“我怎样才能和我的孩子一起假装成考古学家？”你来对地方了！我有一些有趣的小建议要分享……而且**我敢保证**它们非常有效，因为我和 Junior 周末**经常**这样玩！你可以试试这些方法：

**建造你自己的金字塔**  
用积木、枕头，甚至是成堆的衣服！就在客厅里建造你最壮观的金字塔。

想象你现在就在埃及，研究古老的奇观。Junior 的金字塔看起来几乎像真的，但很容易倒塌！

**在后院挖掘遗迹**  
拿上一些小工具，比如汤匙，挖掘宝藏！你可能会发现石头、虫子或旧玩具。假设你在草坪下发现了一座隐藏的古城！Junior 有次找到一个旧钥匙链，还发誓那来自古代文明。

**讲外星人故事**  
**为了好玩**，不妨假设金字塔是外星人建造的。多巧啊！你可以和孩子们交换各种疯狂理论。Junior 超喜欢 UFO 和飞船的点子。这些故事真的能**激发**他们的想象力。

跟着我的这些有趣小妙招，你和孩子们可以过一天考古学家的生活！

保持坚强！

**Which of Eddy's tips sounds most fun to try?**

I think the most fun tip from Eddy is his idea about telling alien stories. That really **appeals** to me because it encourages imagination without needing any special **props**. Honestly, I find it hard to **picture** myself using pillows and laundry to build something like pyramids — it sounds messy and complicated. But when it comes to **storytelling**, especially with aliens involved, I think I could really enjoy that. It’s creative, fun, and something I could easily do at home.

我觉得 Eddy 最有趣的建议是他关于讲外星人故事的点子。这真的很吸引我，因为它鼓励发挥想象力，不需要特别的道具。说实话，我很难想象自己会用枕头和衣服来搭建金字塔——听起来既乱又麻烦。但讲故事，尤其是关于外星人的，我觉得我会很享受。这种方式既有创意又有趣，而且我在家就能轻松做到。

Helpful Phrase: I think/ Eddy's idea about / The most fun tip

I think Eddy's idea about telling alien stories may work for me. I think this is the most fun tip, I can't imagine how to make **pillows** and laundry to build ~~a~~ pyramids, but for stories, that's a good idea.

> Corrections:

1. Fixed the run-on sentence: split "I think this is the most fun tip, I can't imagine..." into two sentences for clarity.
2. "to build a pyramids" → changed to "to build pyramids" (removed incorrect article usage).
3. Changed "make pillows and laundry to build" → "use pillows and laundry to build" for natural phrasing.

I think Eddy's idea about telling alien stories may work for me. I think this is the most fun tip. I can't imagine how to **use** pillows and laundry to build pyramids, but **when it comes to stories**, that's a good idea.

我觉得 Eddy 关于讲外星人故事的主意可能适合我。我觉得这是最有趣的建议。我无法想象怎么用枕头和衣服堆出金字塔，但说故事这个主意倒是不错。
