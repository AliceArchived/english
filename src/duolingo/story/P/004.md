# Perfect for the Job

Junior enters an ice cream store. He speaks to Jerry, the manager.

- **Junior**: Can I have a chocolate ice cream and a job application?
- **Jerry**: Umm… How old are you?
- **Junior**: I’m old enough to know that your chocolate ice cream needs more sugar. Are you the manager?
- **Jerry**: Yes, I am.
- **Junior**: I’m Junior. Listen, if you give me a job, I can help you make a lot of money.
- **Jerry**: But you’re just a kid.
- **Junior**: That’s why I’m perfect for the job.
- **Jerry**: No thanks. Junior.

**Later, Junior is eating his ice cream in front of the store.**

**A family walks past the store and sees Junior.**

- **Junior**: This is the best ice cream I’ve ever had!
- **Little Girl**: Dad, can we get that ice cream?

**They walk into the store.**

- **Father**: That kid’s chocolate ice cream looks amazing! We want four **of the same thing**.
- **Jerry**: Great!

**The family looks very happy as they leave the store.**

- **Jerry**: Junior, you’re a **genius**.
  - But I still can’t give you a job … Because you’re a child.
- **Junior**: That’s OK, you can pay me **in** ice cream.
