# No Refunds, No Problem - B3

A Review by Vikram

Recently, I visited a local store that has a no refund policy. It's a small store with many things to buy. I had quite an adventure there, and here's what happened.

I bought a shiny new clock that looked perfect. But when I got home, the clock didn't work. I realized the clock was defective. Instead of feeling upset, I thought, "Well, it will still look nice on the wall!" It's like a piece of art now. Who needs time, anyway?

The store's policy says no refunds, but I wanted to try and get my money back. I spoke politely to the store manager and asked nicely for a refund.

The manager smiled pleasantly and said, "I'm sorry, but the store policy is very important, and we must follow it."

I appreciated her honesty and understood. Rules are rules!

I also bought a colorful toy for my niece. It was in perfect condition, and it still had the sticker. My niece loved it so much! In fact, I think she loved the sticker more than the toy! So, even if the clock didn't work, the joy on her face made the visit worth it.

This store may not offer refunds, but it offers many other things. Sometimes, the experience is worth more than the item. I smiled all the way back home, happy with my new art piece and my niece's happiness.

Five stars for this charming store!

I think Vikram's attitude shows he is a nice and positive person. It's interesting how the items didn't work and the store manager refused to give him a refund, **yet** Vikram still ~~stays~~ positive.

> Corrections:

1. “a nice and positive person” → “a kind and positive person” 更正式、贴近 IELTS 语域
2. “still stays positive” → 应为过去时 “still stayed positive” 以对应前文 “refused”等过去时态

I think Vikram's attitude shows he is a **kind** and positive person. It's interesting how the items didn’t work and the store manager refused to give him a refund — **yet** Vikram still **stayed** positive.

我觉得 Vikram 的态度展现出他是一个善良且积极的人。有趣的是，商品没起作用，店经理还拒绝退钱，但 Vikram 依然保持乐观。
