# New Walking Tour!

Community Forum: Services

Lin: 3 hours ago

Usually, my friend Bea leads the tours, but recently, she let me lead my own. While Bea likes to schedule everything in advance and go to fifty places, I take a different approach.

I personalize each tour based on the preferences of all the members of the group. And that includes me!

After all, I'm in charge.

Places We May Go:

If you love art, we'll stop by the art museum.

While you all enjoy the new exhibit, I'll be enjoying the tastiest, cheapest pizza from the shop across the street.

You can have as much time at the museum as it takes me to eat two slices of pizza. You'll probably be able to **look at at least** three paintings!

If you like history, we'll go to the statue of the city's first mayor.

This statue just happens to be next to the city's best motorcycle repair shop.

While you read about the statue, I'll work on my motorcycle.

You may want to find a **bench** to sit on because fixing my bike takes a while.

If you enjoy desserts, we'll head to Vikram's bakery.

This bakery is usually on every Best of the City list. Even if you don't love dessert, we'll probably **go** there anyway.

Since I work there part time, I can pick up my pay for the week.

And remember to tip your guide. I take cash or snacks!

## Writing

### Would you go on Lin's tour? Why or why not?

I think Lin's tour is good for me. When I go **on** a tour, I want to relax, I don't want to visit 50 sites **in** a single day.

> - “When I go on a tour, I want to relax, I don't want to visit…” → 逗号连接两个完整句子，应使用连词或分句
> - “50 sites in a single day” → 语法正确，但可以稍微润色使语言更自然

I think Lin's tour would be **a good fit for** me. When I **go on a tour**, I want to relax — not rush around visiting 50 sites in a single day. I **prefer a slower pace** where I can actually enjoy the experience.

我觉得 Lin 的旅游方式很适合我。旅游的时候，我是想放松，不是想一天之内跑完五十个景点。我更喜欢节奏慢一点的行程，这样才能真正享受旅途。

I think Lin's tour is more appropriate for me. For a tour, I don't like it too intense. I just want to relax. Bea's tour is so stressful, I don't think that can be called relaxing.

> - “I think Lin's tour is more appropriate for me.” → 用词没错，但 “appropriate” 在口语中显得太正式、生硬。建议改为 **“a better fit”** 或 **“more my style”**
> - “I don’t like it too intense.” → 应为 “I don’t like **tours that are** too intense.”，不完整
> - “Bea’s tour is so stressful” → 没错，但 “so” 太主观，建议换成 **“seems really stressful”** 更自然

🌟 I think Lin's tour is **a better fit** for me. When I travel, I don’t enjoy tours that are too intense — I just want to relax and enjoy the experience. Bea’s tour seems really stressful, and to me, that doesn’t feel like a vacation at all.

我觉得 Lin 的行程更适合我。旅游的时候我不喜欢行程太紧张，我只是想放松、享受过程。Bea 的行程看起来太累人了，对我来说那根本算不上放松的假期。

#### 🌟Would you go on Lin’s tour? Why or why not?

Yes, I’d love to go on Lin’s tour. Her style is really relaxed and different from traditional tours. Unlike Bea, who plans everything and visits fifty places, Lin focuses on enjoyment and flexibility.

I like how she personalizes each tour based on the group’s interests — and even her own! For example, while others are visiting the art museum, she grabs a couple of slices of pizza across the street. That kind of humor and freedom makes the tour feel less stressful and more fun.

Also, I think it would be interesting to see where the tour ends up, since nothing is strictly planned. It sounds like a unique experience, and honestly, I wouldn’t mind tipping her with a snack at the end!

是的，我非常愿意参加 Lin 的旅行。她的风格非常轻松，和传统的旅行团不一样。和 Bea 那种安排得密密麻麻、一天跑几十个景点的风格不同，Lin 更注重享受和灵活。

我喜欢她根据团队成员的兴趣来个性化行程——甚至包括她自己的兴趣！比如，当大家在参观艺术馆时，她去街对面的披萨店吃两片披萨。那种幽默感和自由度让这次旅行听起来一点都不累，反而很好玩。

而且，行程不完全固定，我觉得那种“不知道下一个目的地是什么”的感觉挺有趣的。最后还能用零食当小费，我真的愿意试试！

#### **Describe a tour or trip you would like to go on**

_You should say:_
– where you would like to go
– who you would like to go with
– what you would like to do
and explain why you would like to go on this tour

#### **Sample Answer:**

One type of tour I **would** really **like to go on** is the kind that Lin organizes — a slow-paced, relaxing tour with fewer destinations and more time to enjoy each place. Personally, I’m not a fan of rushing from one site to another, trying to **check off** as many places as possible in a single day. I **prefer** quality **over** quantity when it **comes to** travel.

Ideally, I would go on this kind of tour in **a scenic place**, like a countryside town or a coastal area. I’d love to go with a few close friends, so we could enjoy the trip together without feeling **pressured** to keep up with a tight schedule.

What I’d like to do is simple: walk around, **take in the atmosphere**, try local food, and maybe visit a few **cultural or historical spots** — but only a few, not fifty! The point is to relax and enjoy the experience, not to be exhausted at the end of each day.

That’s why I think Lin’s tour style suits me very well. It allows people **to slow down**, **enjoy the moment**, and **make real memories**, instead of just rushing from one photo spot to another.

我最想参加的一种旅行，就是像 Lin 组织的那种——节奏慢、以放松为主的旅行，不是那种赶景点、一天看几十个地方的团。我个人不喜欢那种行程太紧凑、走马观花的方式，我更在乎旅行的质量，而不是数量。

理想中我会去一个风景优美的地方，比如乡村小镇或海边。我想和几位好朋友一起去旅行，这样我们可以轻松自在地享受旅程，不会被时间表压得很紧。

我想做的事情其实很简单：走走看看，**感受当地氛围**，尝尝当地美食，也许顺便参观一两个文化或历史景点——但真的只是一两个，不要五十个！我希望旅行是放松的，不是每天下来累得半死。

所以我觉得 Lin 的旅行风格非常适合我。它让人慢下来，享受当下，留下真正的回忆，而不是只是从一个打卡点赶到下一个而已。

| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **slow-paced / relaxing tour**           | 描述旅游风格的好词           |
| **check off as many places as possible** | 形象表达“打卡式旅游”         |
| **quality over quantity**                | 旅行态度升华用语             |
| **take in the atmosphere**               | 高分口语短语，表示“感受氛围” |
| **be exhausted at the end of the day**   | 形象表达疲惫感               |
| **make real memories**                   | 结尾升华，表达旅行意义       |

**“go on a tour”** 和 **“go to a tour”** 有很大的区别：

---

#### ✅ 正确表达：

**✅ go on a tour** → ✔ 表示**参加某个行程、旅游团或旅程**

- ✅ _I’d love to go on a tour of Italy someday._
- ✅ _She went on a guided tour of the museum._
- ✅ _One type of tour I’d like to go on is the kind that Lin organizes._ ✅（你原句是正确的）

---

#### ❌ 错误或不自然表达：

**❌ go to a tour** → ❌ 通常不说 go to a tour，因为 “tour” 指的是过程/活动，而不是一个地点或单一事件

- ✖ _go to a concert_ ✔（正确）
- ✖ _go to a place_ ✔（正确）
- ✖ _go to a tour_ ❌（不自然，不常用）

---

> 记忆建议：
>
> - 如果是一次“经历、活动” → 用 **go on**（如 tour, trip, cruise, vacation）
> - 如果是去一个“地点、场所” → 用 **go to**（如 school, party, museum）

✅ _One type of tour I would like to **go on** is..._

✅ _I would love to **join** a tour like the one Lin organizes._

- scenic: 英 /ˈsiːnɪk/ 美 /ˈsiːnɪk/

  - adj. 舞台的；风景优美的；戏剧的
  - n. 风景照片；风景胜地

- **“check off” 的意思：**
  - “**Check off**” 是一个**口语化短语动词**，意思是：
    - ✔ **在清单上勾掉一个项目**，表示“完成了、看过了、经历过了”
    - Personally, I’m not a fan of rushing from one site to another, trying to check off as many places as possible in a single day.
    - 我不喜欢那种从一个景点赶到另一个景点、一天之内尽可能多地“打卡”景点的旅行方式。
    - 这里的 **“check off”** 指的就是：
      **“把景点当成清单上的任务，一个个去过，然后就勾掉”**，不注重体验，而是“完成任务式”旅游。
    - ✅ _I’ve checked off five countries on my travel bucket list._
      我已经完成了旅行清单上的五个国家。
      ✅ _She loves checking off tasks — it gives her a sense of accomplishment._
      她喜欢勾掉任务清单上的内容，这让她有成就感。

英文中 **“pressure” vs “pressured”** 的细微差别

I’d love to go with a few close friends, so we could enjoy the trip together without feeling **pressured** to keep up with a tight schedule.

我希望和几个好朋友一起去旅行，这样我们就可以一起享受旅程，而不用感到有压力去赶紧凑的行程。

这里用 **“pressured”** 是因为你要表达的是**“感受到压力的状态”**，而不是“压力”这个抽象名词本身。

这句话的主语是 **“we”**，后面的 “feeling pressured” 是一个**状态或感受**，意思是：“不感到有压力去赶行程。”

| 单词          | 类型              | 含义                | 用法示例                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **pressure**  | 名词              | 外部的压力、紧迫感  | ✅ _I’m under a lot of pressure at work._ ✅ _The pressure to succeed is huge._       |
| **pressured** | 形容词 / 过去分词 | 被迫感 / 感受到压力 | ✅ _I felt pressured to say yes._ ✅ _Students often feel pressured to perform well._ |

❌ _“…without feeling **pressure** to keep up with a tight schedule.”_
→ **不完全错**，但感觉像是“没有‘压力’存在”，而不是“没有‘感到压力’”。

✅ _“…without feeling **pressured**…”_
→ 更贴切，更口语，强调人的**感受**状态。

take in the atmosphere

“**take in the atmosphere**” 是一个**地道且高级的英语表达**，意思是：**沉浸其中、感受现场的氛围**，不仅仅是“看到”或“听到”，而是**用心体验那种感觉**。

| 短语                          | 意思                                   | 中文表达            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **take in**                   | 吸收、感受、欣赏（抽象或具体事物）     | 吸收、体会、欣赏    |
| **the atmosphere**            | 环境氛围（如街道、人群、灯光、声音等） | 气氛 / 环境感受     |
| ✅ **take in the atmosphere** | 意为“细细感受当下的气氛”               | 沉浸其中 / 体会氛围 |

What I’d like to do is simple: walk around, take in the atmosphere, try local food...

“我不追求打卡式旅游，我只想散步，静静感受那里的氛围，品尝当地美食。”

### 对比表达：

| 不推荐                 | 更自然的表达                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| _see the place_        | _take in the atmosphere_（更深层感受）   |
| _walk around the area_ | _walk around and take in the atmosphere_ |

- _We sat at a café and just took in the atmosphere of the city._
  我们坐在咖啡馆里，静静感受这座城市的氛围。
- _At the old temple, I took in the atmosphere and felt truly peaceful._
  在那座古庙中，我沉浸在氛围中，感到非常宁静。

| **see the sights**              | 看景点（偏“打卡”）                         | 旅游团式行程、快节奏         | ⭐⭐（基础但普通）      | We spent the whole day seeing the sights around the city.                   |

想表达“用心感受、沉浸在环境中”→ **✔ take in the atmosphere**（适合街头、小镇、节日、夜景）

想表达“深入体验文化、习俗”→ **✔ soak up the culture**

想表达“快速熟悉一个地方”→ **✔ get a feel for the place**

## Sentences

- You'll probably be able to **look at at least** three paintings!

  - **“look at at least…”** 中两个 **at** 连在一起，虽然语法上不错，但视觉上容易误读。

    建议写成：**look at** _a minimum of_ three paintings 或保持原句但注意排版。
