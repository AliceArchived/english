# Nature Hike

Zari and Lily are hiking through the forest. Lily keeps looking at her phone.

- **Zari**: Why did you bring your phone? We should enjoy nature.
- **Lily**: I'm not going into the woods without my phone. It's too dangerous.
- **Zari**: It's not dangerous. It's beautiful. Look around you!
- **Lily**: I only see danger.

Lily takes a photo of a plant with her phone.

- **Lily**: My app says this plant is poisonous. Don't eat it.
- **Zari**: I'm not going to eat random plants, Lily.

Lily and Zari keep walking.

- **Zari**: These trees are amazing.
- **Lily**: Falling trees kill over one hundred people every year.
- **Zari**: Look at these footprints! Cool!
- **Lily**: It might be a wolf.
- **Zari**: I'm pretty sure they're duck footprints.

Lily takes a photo with her phone.

- **Lily**: The app says they're duck footprints.
- **Zari**: That's what I just said.

Zari leads Lily up a hill.

- **Zari**: Look! There's a waterfall!

Lily is still looking at the footprints on her phone. Zari turns around to look for Lily.

- **Zari**: Lily, you're missing everything!

Without looking, Zari **walks into a spider web**.

- **Zari**: Ahh! I think there's a spider on my head!

Zari jumps up and down and waves her arms.

- **Zari**: Help! **Get** this spider **off** me!

Lily runs up to Zari with her phone.

- **Lily**: Stop moving, Zari! I'm trying to help!
- **Zari**: It might be poisonous! I'm going to die!

Lily takes a photo of the spider, then **brushes** the spider **off** of Zari's head.

- **Lily**: Relax. The app says it's not poisonous.

Lily shows Zari the picture of the spider on her phone.

- **Lily**: Look, that spider was beautiful!
- **Zari**: Oh, wow! I never even got to see it!
- **Lily**: Aren't you happy I brought my phone?

## Sentences

- **“off of Zari’s head”**
  Common in informal speech, but in writing, **“off Zari’s head”** is cleaner and more natural.
  ✔ Suggested: **“brushes the spider off Zari’s head.”**
- Lily 给蜘蛛拍了张照片，然后把蜘蛛从 Zari 的头上刷掉了。
  - Lily takes a photo of the spider, then **brushes** the spider **off** of Zari's head.

“brush off” 是一个常见的动词短语，表示轻轻地扫除或拍掉某物，用于**从表面上移除小东西**（如灰尘、头发、昆虫等）时非常合适。

例如：

- **She brushed the dust off her jacket.**
- **He brushed crumbs off the table.**

## Writing

### What happened in the story?

Lily and Zari were hiking through a forest. Lily was taking her phone with her and Zari thought it was unnecessary. However, when they came across a spider, the cell phone helped them ~~to~~ find out the spider was ~~poisonousness~~ and it was beautiful.

> 1. **“was taking her phone with her”** → 更自然表达为 **“brought her phone with her”**（过去完成动作）
> 2. **“the cell phone helped them to find out”** → “helped” 后面直接用动词原形：**“helped them find out”**
> 3. **“poisonousness”** → 拼写错误，应该是 **“poisonous”**（形容词）
> 4. **“and it was beautiful”** → 用 **“and also beautiful”** 更自然地并列两个判断

Lily and Zari were hiking through a forest. Lily **brought** her phone with her, **but** Zari thought it was unnecessary. However, when they **came across** a spider, the phone helped them find out that the spider was **poisonous** and also beautiful.

Lily 和 Zari 在森林中远足。Lily 带了手机，但 Zari 觉得没必要。然而，当她们遇到一只蜘蛛时，手机帮她们查出这只蜘蛛既有毒，也很漂亮。

语法正确、表达自然的改写如下：

Lily and Zari were hiking through the forest. Zari didn’t understand why Lily brought her phone, but Lily insisted it was for safety. As they walked, Lily kept using her phone to identify plants and animals. When Zari accidentally walked into a spider web, she panicked, thinking the spider might be poisonous. Lily quickly took a picture of the spider, and her app confirmed it wasn’t dangerous — and it was actually beautiful. In the end, Lily proved her phone was useful.

Lily 和 Zari 在森林里远足。Zari 不明白为什么 Lily 要带手机，但 Lily 坚持说是为了安全。一路上 Lily 不断用手机识别植物和动物。后来 Zari 不小心撞进蜘蛛网，担心蜘蛛有毒而惊慌失措。Lily 迅速拍照，并用她的应用确认这只蜘蛛没有毒，而且还很漂亮。最后，Lily 证明了手机确实有用。
