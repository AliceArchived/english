# New Roommate

Lin is drinking wine with her friend Dana at a restaurant.

- **Lin**: I don’t want you to move away!
- **Dana**: I know, but this city is too expensive. My apartment costs too much!
- **Lin**: I have an idea! What if you stay with me and my grandma? You can sleep on the couch!
- **Dana**: Wow, really? Are you sure?
- **Lin**: But you have to meet my grandma first. It is her apartment.
- **Dana**: What if we don’t get along?
- **Lin**: I’m sure she’ll love you! Well, I’m pretty sure …

**Later that week, Dana meets Lucy at her apartment.**

- **Lucy**: Lin said you need a place to stay. You seem nice, but I want to make sure that you will be a good roommate.
- **Dana**: Of course. I completely understand.
- **Lucy**: Do you usually stay up late?
- **Dana**: I **used to** stay up late, but now I go to bed early.
- **Lucy**: Do you have a job?
- **Dana**: I work at a restaurant now, but when I finish my degree, I’ll be a lawyer.
- **Lucy**: Do you usually drink tea or coffee?
- **Dana**: Well, I hate coffee.
  - But I drink tea every day! Do you want me to make some?
- **Lucy**: Hmm … I like you.

**Later, Lin comes home. She sees Lucy drinking tea in the kitchen.**

- **Lin**: What do you think, Grandma? Can Dana stay?
- **Lucy**: Yes, Dana can stay!
- **Lin**: Thank you!
- **Lucy**: And she offered to pay, so I gave her your room.
