# New Hobby

**Lily’s mother enters Lily’s bedroom.**

- **mother**: Lily? You should get up.
- **Lily**: You should leave my room.
- **mother**: You’ve been in bed all day. It’s summer!
- **Lily**: I want to stay in bed and think about darkness. The world is terrible.
- **mother**: Teenagers are so dramatic!
  - When I was your age, I went out with my friends, swam every day, and learned new languages!
- **Lily**: Learning new languages? That sounds very boring.
- **mother**: You should get a hobby. Hobbies are fun!
- **Lily**: Lying in bed is my hobby.
- **mother**: You could join a book club.
- **Lily**: I read alone. Like a normal person.
- **mother**: **Photography**?
- **Lily**: Ugh. No thanks.
- **mother**: Oh! You like music, don’t you?
- **Lily**: Yeah …
- **mother**: You could play an instrument.
  - Your dad has some old drums.
- **Lily**: Hmm. Drums are cool …

**Four hours later, Lily is playing the drums. It’s loud.**

**Very loud.**

- **mother**: Lily, can you stop playing the drums now?
- **Lily**: But it’s my new hobby. And I need to practice at least three hours a day.
- **Mother**: Your new hobby is giving me a headache. Now I need to **lie down**.
