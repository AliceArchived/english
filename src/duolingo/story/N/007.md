# Nobody's Perfect - B2

Eddy and his neighbor Lin are sitting in Vikram's bakery when their friend Bea runs in.

- **Bea**: I did it!
- **Lin**: You've finally stopped being obsessed with being perfect?
- **Bea**: No! I finally launched the dating app I've been working on!
  - And I've made profiles for both of you.
- **Lin**: What?! You know I hate dating apps.
- **Eddy**: But I already use five other dating apps.
- **Bea**: Mine is different! You'll never find the love of your life if you're looking for someone without **flaws**. Nobody's perfect ... except me.
  - My app puts your flaws at the top of your profile. With this strategy, everyone can find love faster!
- **Lin**: This sounds terrible.
- **Eddy**: No, it's brilliant! Which bad qualities should I put on my profile?
- **Bea**: I already added your flaws! I'm really good at observing people.

Bea shows them her phone.

- **Eddy**: My profile says I talk about fitness a lot ... As far as I know, that's not a flaw.
- **Lin**: Mine says I talk about writing my memoir all the time, but I never write.
- **Eddy**: Hey, that's not true!
- **Lin**: Actually, it is.
  - But now people are going to know I use writing as an excuse to avoid doing things! Bea, you must delete my profile.
- **Bea**: Don't be upset. I was trying to help!

Bea's phone buzzes. She shows them the messages in the app.

- **Eddy**: Wow, I just matched with a woman who's obsessed with lifting weights.
- **Lin**: And I matched with a woman who says she also **procrastinates**!
- **Bea**: I told you my app works!
- **Eddy**: Bea, show us your profile!
- **Bea**: Oh... I don't have one. As far as I'm aware, I don't have any flaws.

Lin takes Bea's phone.

- **Lin**: Here, let me make your profile. I know all your flaws ...

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Would you use a dating app like this one? Why or why not?**

Personally, I wouldn’t feel comfortable using a dating app. I think it’s quite hard to **genuinely understand** someone just through online messages. Also, with so many data leaks happening nowadays, I **feel uneasy** about sharing personal details. From both a technical and personal **perspective**, it seems too risky to put sensitive information online.

就我个人而言，我不太愿意使用交友软件。我认为光靠网络聊天很难真正了解一个人。而且现在数据泄露事件频发，我对分享个人信息感到不安。从技术和个人的角度来看，把敏感信息放到网上太冒险了。

### Practice History

**Would you use a dating app like this one? Why or why not?**

No, I would not use any dating apps. In my opinion, dating online is not safe, and **it** can also be a leak source of private information. **Also**, there is **a mature** industry online to hunt people who **want** to find a date online.

No, I would not **use** any dating app. **People** cannot know other people **through** apps. And there **is** too much personal information **leaked** on **the** internet. From both the **technical** or **personal** **standpoint**, it's not safe to put too much private information online.

> Corrections:

1. "use any dating app" — grammatically fine, but could be softened to "I wouldn’t feel comfortable using a dating app" for IELTS Band 7+ tone.
2. "People cannot know other people through apps" — awkward phrasing. Better: “It’s hard to truly get to know someone through an app.”
3. "there is too much personal information leaked on the internet" — grammatically awkward; better: “too much personal information is leaked online.”
4. "from both the technical or personal standpoint" — mix-up of “both … and” vs. “either … or.” Should be: “from both a technical and a personal standpoint.”
5. Tone is a bit blunt; IELTS Band 7+ encourages balanced tone and precise vocabulary.

No, I **wouldn’t feel comfortable** using any dating app. It’s difficult to truly **get to know** someone through an app, and too much personal information is leaked online these days. From **both** a technical **and** a personal **standpoint**, **I don’t think** it’s safe to share too much private information on the internet.
