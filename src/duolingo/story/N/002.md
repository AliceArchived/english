# Neighborhood Threat - B2

Koko's Karaoke Bar has recently opened next to Oscar's house.

Oscar is outside protesting alone while yelling into a **megaphone**.

- **Oscar**: Karaoke isn't music! I'd prefer to hear dogs **howling** all night, like when this was an animal shelter. Go sing badly in another neighborhood.

Oscar's friends Lucy and Lin walk by.

- **Lin**: If you don't mind me asking, what are you protesting?
- **Lucy**: Unfair worker treatment?
  - Government corruption?
- **Oscar**: Worse! Karaoke!
- **Lin**: I love karaoke!
- **Lucy**: Let's go inside! Maybe we can protest later, Oscar.
- **Oscar**: **Traitors**!

Oscar holds up a sign that says "Ban Karaoke." He waves it wildly as Eddy approaches.

- **Eddy**: Ooh, Oscar! Is that your latest artwork?
- **Oscar**: This isn't art. It's a sign, Eddy. Hold it and join my protest!
- **Eddy**: Sure!
- **Oscar**: Finally, someone understands the threat of karaoke.
- **Eddy**: Actually, I love karaoke! I'm just here because you looked lonely.

As Eddy waves the sign, a popular song plays in Koko's.

- **Eddy**: Wait, they're playing my favorite song to sing in the shower!

Eddy runs inside. Oscar **sighs** and continues protesting. Koko, the karaoke bar owner, walks out smiling.

- **Koko**: Welcome! Why don't you come in?
- **Oscar**: Never! I'd rather shave my precious mustache!
- **Koko**: Well, I was just going to say that I've heard you shouting all morning ... and wow! Your voice is so powerful!
- **Oscar**: Yes, I always stand out ...
- **Koko**: To get back to my question ... I was wondering if you'd come in and sing a song for us. I'll give you free wine!
- **Oscar**: Wine? I don't suppose you have any from Argentina?
- **Koko**: We have wine from every region!
- **Oscar**: Really?
- **Koko**: Now, let's hear your beautiful voice!

Oscar enters Koko's. He takes a dramatic breath before performing a solo from an opera.

- **Oscar**: La la ... lalala!

Glasses start to **vibrate**. Everyone gasps. Koko claps loudly.

- **Koko**: Bravo!
- **Oscar**: I'll be at karaoke every weekend!
- **Lucy**: Oh no, Lin... Maybe this place is a threat to our neighborhood ...

## Vocabulary

- megaphone: 扩音器
- Traitor: 叛徒

## Sentences

- 卡拉 OK 根本不算音乐！我宁愿整晚听狗叫，就像这里以前是动物收容所的时候那样。请到别的社区去难听地唱歌吧。
  - Karaoke isn't music! I'd prefer to hear dogs **howling** all night, like when this was an animal shelter. Go sing badly in another neighborhood.

## Writing

### What do you think about karaoke? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I don't love karaoke. It's OK for me to listen to other people singing, but I don't like singing at karaoke. I'm not good at singing.

> - **"I don't love karaoke"**
>   - 语法没错，但 “don't love” 听起来有些生硬。英语口语中更自然的表达是 “I’m not really into…” 或 “I don’t really enjoy…”
> - **"It's OK for me to listen to other people singing"**
>   - 语法接近正确，但不够地道。英语中更自然的结构是：
>     - “I’m fine with listening to other people sing.”（更口语）
>     - 原句中“singing”虽然可以接受，但在这类结构中用 “sing” 更常见（省略 to），符合听说习惯。
> - **"I don't like singing at karaoke."**
>   - 表达清楚，但略显重复，前一句已经提到不喜欢唱。可以合并简化，提升流畅度。
> - **"I'm not good at singing."**
>   - 没有语法错误，但作为结束句略显突兀。可以用 “That’s probably because…” 来更自然地引出理由。

I don’t **really** love karaoke. I’m **fine with** listening to other people **sing**, but I’m **not a fan of** singing myself — mostly because I’m not very good at it. I tend to feel a bit shy or awkward when I have to perform in front of others.
我并不特别喜欢卡拉 OK。听别人唱歌我觉得还可以，但我自己不太喜欢唱歌——主要是因为我唱得不太好。让我当着别人面表演，我会觉得有点害羞或尴尬。

### **范文：Do you like karaoke?**

To be honest, I’m not really into karaoke. I know a lot of people find it fun and entertaining, but personally, it’s just not my thing. I’m perfectly fine with listening to others sing — some people are really talented or just have great energy — but when it comes to singing myself, I usually avoid it.

One reason is that I’m not very confident in my singing skills. I always feel a bit awkward standing in front of others with a microphone, especially if it’s a big group. It makes me feel self-conscious, and instead of having fun, I end up feeling nervous.

That said, I can still enjoy the atmosphere. If I go with close friends, I might join in once or twice just for fun, but overall, I prefer being a listener rather than a performer.

说实话，我并不是很喜欢唱卡拉 OK。我知道很多人觉得它很有趣也很解压，但对我来说，它不是我喜欢的活动。我完全可以接受听别人唱歌——有些人真的唱得很好，或者气氛很好——但要我自己唱的话，我通常会避免。

一个主要原因是我对自己的唱歌水平不太有信心。我总觉得站在大家面前拿着麦克风很尴尬，尤其是人多的时候，会让我感到紧张，而不是放松。

不过，我还是能享受卡拉 OK 的氛围。如果是和很熟的朋友一起去，我可能会为了好玩唱一两首，但整体来说，我更喜欢做个听众，而不是表演者。
