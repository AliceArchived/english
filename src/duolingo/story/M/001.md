# Making a Tuxedo - B3

Eddy and Junior are in their living room, looking at an invitation.

- **Junior**: Dad, this says the gala is black-tie. That means we need a tuxedo, right?
- **Eddy**: That's right! But don't worry, Junior. I have a great idea. I'll make my own tuxedo!
- **Junior**: You'll… make a tuxedo? Are you sure about that?
- **Eddy**: Of course! It'll be fun. And it's cheaper! Renting tuxedos is so expensive.
- **Junior**: Or… we can just rent one. We have to look good, Dad. People at galas look sophisticated.
- **Eddy**: Don't worry, Junior. I've got this. Trust me!

Eddy brings out an old sewing machine and some black fabric.

- **Junior**: Where did that sewing machine come from?
- **Eddy**: The closet! I've had it for years.

Eddy begins sewing. The machine makes a loud **clucking** noise.

- **Eddy**: Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I just need to adjust it.
- **Junior**: Or maybe we need to rent a tuxedo…

Eddy keeps sewing. The fabric tears, and pieces go flying.

- **Junior**: Dad… I think the tuxedo is supposed to stay in one piece.
- **Eddy**: Alright, this… um… didn't go as planned.
- **Junior**: So… the tuxedo shop?
- **Eddy**: Yeah, let's go. But next time, I'll build us a limo.
- **Junior**: Please no.

## Vocabulary

- cluck: 英 /klʌk/, 美 /klʌk/
  - n. (母鸡)咯咯声
  - <俚>傻瓜，笨蛋

## Sentences

- Junior 建议燕尾服应该保持完整。
  - Junior suggests the tuxedo should remain **intact**.
  - Dad… I think the tuxedo is supposed to stay in one piece.
  - 就是幽默地表达：你缝的这套燕尾服怎么缝着缝着就撕裂、碎片乱飞了？
- Yeah, let's go. But next time, I'll build us a **limo**.
  - Eddy wanted to make a tuxedo.
  - 为什么是 limo？
    - 夸张幽默（Humorous exaggeration）：
      - Eddy 明明做不好一套衣服，却又大言不惭说“下次我就造辆豪车”。这是一种典型的喜剧效果 —— 用更荒谬的提议掩饰刚刚的失败，让对话轻松收尾。
    - 角色设定：Eddy 是个“乐观爱 DIY 又不太靠谱”的爸爸：
      - 他喜欢“自己动手”，但常常搞砸。做不成衣服，还幻想自己能造一辆豪车，是角色性格的延伸。
    - 用更大的梦想来逃避当前的失败：
      - 他可能在想：“做衣服失败了？没关系！下次我做更大的东西！”
      - 实际上，是一种幽默地掩盖尴尬的方式。
    - 如果他说“下次我再做衣服”会怎样？
      - 那就没有这个“荒谬对比”的喜剧效果了。作者特意设计 limo 是为了让 Junior 回一句： Please no.（拜托别。）
      - 这一句才是整个对话的喜剧收尾 —— 小孩已经彻底对爸爸的“DIY 雄心”失去信心了 😂。
    - Eddy 说 “下次我造辆 limo”，不是因为礼服不重要，而是为了制造幽默效果。通过夸张和跳跃性的梦想，展现角色的搞笑个性和父子之间轻松调侃的互动。

制作燕尾服

Eddy 和 Junior 在客厅里看着一张请柬。

- **Junior**：爸，这上面写着晚会是黑领带要求。那就表示我们需要穿燕尾服，对吧？
- **Eddy**：没错！但别担心，Junior。我有个好主意。我自己做一套燕尾服！
- **Junior**：你要……自己做一套燕尾服？你确定吗？
- **Eddy**：当然了！这会很有趣。而且更便宜！租燕尾服太贵了。
- **Junior**：或者……我们可以直接租一套。我们得看起来很体面，爸。参加晚会的人都很有气质。
- **Eddy**：别担心，Junior。我搞得定。相信我！

Eddy 拿出一台旧缝纫机和一些黑布。

- **Junior**：这缝纫机哪来的？
- **Eddy**：壁橱里！我已经有很多年了。

Eddy 开始缝纫。缝纫机发出很大的 **咔哒** 声。

- **Eddy**：嗯，这声音不太对。也许我只需要调整一下。
- **Junior**：或者我们还是去租一套燕尾服吧……

Eddy 继续缝纫。布料撕裂，碎片飞得到处都是。

- **Junior**：爸……我觉得燕尾服应该是完整的一件。
- **Eddy**：好吧，这个……呃……好像没按计划进行。
- **Junior**：所以……去燕尾服店？
- **Eddy**：好吧，我们去。但下次，我要给我们造一辆豪华轿车。
- **Junior**：求你别了。

**What did Eddy want to make instead of renting?**

Eddy didn’t want to rent a tuxedo — he preferred to make one himself because he liked creating things and wanted to try doing it on his own. However, his attempt failed, and in the end, he had to rent one anyway. **Interestingly**, he remained **optimistic**. At the end of the story, instead of talking about trying the tuxedo again, he said that next time, he would build a limo for them, which shows his **creative spirit** and **big dreams**.

Eddy 不想租礼服——他更愿意自己做一套，因为他喜欢动手创造，想尝试自己完成。不过，他这次没能成功，最后还是租了一套。有趣的是，他依然很乐观。在故事结尾，他并没有说要下次再试着做礼服，而是说下次要自己造一辆豪华轿车，这展现了他富有创造力的个性和远大的梦想。

Instead of renting a tuxedo, Eddy wanted to make his own because he thought it would be more meaningful and possibly save money. Unfortunately, he didn't succeed the first time he tried, but he didn’t give up. He felt that with more effort and practice, he could manage it in the future. His decision to try again shows determination and creativity, and it also reflects his desire to accomplish something on his own rather than rely on **external options**.

Eddy 不想租礼服，而是希望自己亲手制作，因为他觉得这样更有意义，也许还能省钱。可惜他第一次尝试时没有成功，但他并没有放弃。他认为只要继续努力和练习，未来一定能做到。他决定再次尝试，展现了他的决心与创造力，也反映了他希望靠自己完成事情，而不是依赖外部资源。

### Practice History

**What did Eddy want to make instead of renting?**

Helpful Phrases: Eddy wanted/ make his own/ instead of

Eddy wanted to make his own tuxedo ~~by himself~~ instead of renting one, but he failed. However, he wanted to make it the next time.

> Corrections:

1. Removed “by himself” — it's redundant because “make his own” already implies personal effort.
2. Changed “he wanted to make it the next time” to “he hoped to succeed next time” — more natural and idiomatic.

Eddy wanted to make his own tuxedo instead of renting one, but he failed. However, he hoped to succeed next time.

Eddy 想自己做一套礼服，而不是租一套，但他失败了。不过，他希望下次能成功。

> Corrections:

1. 原文中 Eddy 确实一开始是想做一套自己的礼服（tuxedo），这是对的。
2. 但 “next time” 指的不是 **再做一套礼服**，而是他想 **下次自己造一辆豪华轿车（limo）**，所以你最后一句“he wanted to make it the next time”语义错误了。

Eddy wanted to make his own tuxedo instead of renting one, but he failed. However, next time, **he said he would build them a limo**.

Eddy 原本想自己做一套礼服而不是去租，但他失败了。不过，他说下次要自己造一辆豪华轿车。
