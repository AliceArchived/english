# Moving

Lucy is helping her granddaughter, Lin, pack her suitcases.

- **Lucy**: You're finally moving out of my apartment!
- **Lin**: I feel like I just moved here.
- **Lucy**: And five years later, you're finally moving out.
  - Are you ready?
- **Lin**: I'm going to miss this comfortable couch!
- **Lucy**: Now you can sleep in a real bed!
- **Lin**: And I will have a lot more roommates.
- **Lucy**: You'll make some new friends!
- **Lin**: Who will wake you up when you don't hear your alarm clock?
- **Lucy**: Oh… maybe I need a louder alarm clock.
- **Lin**: And who will help you carry groceries?
- **Lucy**: I'm still very strong, thank you very much.
- **Lin**: And who will read the newspaper with you on Sunday mornings?
- **Lucy**: Oh… I don't know.
  - And who will eat chocolate cake with me!? And watch scary movies? And go dancing on Fridays?
- **Lin**: I don't know!
  - Maybe I need to stay here... for you.

Lin looks at her suitcases. Lucy smiles.

- **Lucy**: Yes... you should stay.
- **Lin**: Great!

Lin starts unpacking her suitcases.

- **Lucy**: But you can't sleep on the couch tonight. I have a date coming over!
