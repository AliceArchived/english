# My Horse Hates Me

Zari and Lily are at a farm in the countryside.

- **Lily**: I can't believe we're going to ride horses. I think I'm allergic to them.
- **Zari**: It'll be fun. Horses are magical creatures!
- **Lily**: Horses are dangerous animals, and you can't trust them.
- **Zari**: I've heard that if you look into a horse's eyes, then you can see the future.
- **Lily**: Why are we friends?

Zari ignores Lily and points to a white horse.

- **Zari**: I want that one!
- **Man**: That horse is very challenging.
- **Zari**: I love challenges!
  - Lily, you should ride the black one! She's so pretty!
- **Man**: I must warn you. That horse is very old, and she doesn't have a lot of energy.
- **Lily**: Perfect.

Zari **gets on** the white horse, and it immediately starts running away from the farm.

- **Zari**: Stop! Please, stop!

The horse suddenly stops, and Zari almost falls off.

- **Zari**: This horse is trying to kill me!

Lily rides her horse over to Zari.

- **Lily**: I don't think you're doing it right.
- **Zari**: He's crazy. I can't control him!
- **Lily**: My horse is so calm. I think we have a special connection.
- **Zari**: You have a connection already?
- **Lily**: Are you jealous?
- **Zari**: No! I just need to spend more time with my horseâ€¦
- **Lily**: Ah-choo!

Lily sneezes, and Zari's horse jumps.

Zari falls into a **puddle** of water.

- **Zari**: My horse hates me! I give up.
- **Lily**: Mine is pretty cool. She lets me hug her.

Lily leans forward and hugs her horse.

- **Lily**: I think I like horses more than people.

Lily rides away. Zari looks into her horse's eyes.

- **Zari**: Oh no, I can see my future.
  - I think I'm going to have a difficult ride back to the farm.
