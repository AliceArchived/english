# My Money, My Rules

Junior and Eddy are shopping at a local mall when Junior **spots** a video game on a shelf and runs to grab it.

- **Junior**: Dad! It's Zombie Feast! Can we get it, please?
- **Eddy**: No, Junior, you can't have it. You already have two zombie games at home.
- **Junior**: But in this game, you get to play as a zombie instead of a human!
- **Eddy**: Sorry, Junior.
- **Junior**: According to experts, playing video games actually helps young **brains** by teaching important fine motor skills.
- **Eddy**: Who are these "experts"?
- **Junior**: My friend **Davey**. He's twelve.
- **Eddy**: No, Junior. You have too many video games.
- **Junior**: You're being unreasonable!
- **Eddy**: Junior, when you have your own money, you may buy whatever you want. But until then, I'm not letting you get this game.

One week later, Eddy comes home **to** find Junior playing a video game.

- **Eddy**: Junior! Is that Zombie Feast?!
- **Junior**: Yeah.
- **Eddy**: I told you that you couldn't buy that game!
- **Junior**: You said I was allowed to buy it if I made my own money.
- **Eddy**: I did?
- **Junior**: I made $100 from my dog walking business, so I bought the game myself.

Junior continues playing.

- **Junior**: Don't the **graphics** look cool, Dad?
- **Eddy**: Yeah… I see why you wanted this game. Can I play?
- **Junior**: No. You can play the game when you buy it with your own money.
- **Eddy**: Oh, is that how it is, Junior?

Eddy goes into the kitchen and makes a phone call.

Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rings. It's a man **delivering** pizza.

- **Eddy**: Mmm… That smells amazing, doesn't it, Junior? Too bad you can't have any because I'm buying it with my own money.
- **Junior**: Aw, that's so unfair!
- **Man**: That'll be $25, please.

Eddy looks in his wallet. It's empty.

- **Eddy**: Oh. Uhhh… Junior? Can I borrow some cash?

**Do you think Eddy is being unfair to Junior? Why or why not?**

No, I don’t think Eddy is being unfair to Junior. Since Junior is still a child, it makes sense to set some **boundaries** when it **comes** to buying video games. Eddy is a teacher, and his income is limited, so he has to be careful with spending. I believe he’s being responsible rather than unfair.

不，我不认为 Eddy 对 Junior 不公平。因为 Junior 还只是个孩子，所以在购买电子游戏方面设定一些界限是有道理的。Eddy 是一名老师，收入有限，因此他必须谨慎花钱。我认为他是负责任的，而不是不公平。

### Practice History

**How did Junior earn money for the game?**

Junior earned / dog-walking / used to buy

Junior earned $100 from his dog-walking business, and he used the money to buy Zombie Feast — the video game Eddy **had refused** to buy **for** him **earlier**.

**Do you think Eddy is being unfair to Junior? Why or why not?**

I don't think Eddy is being unfair to Junior. Junior is a kid, **so** when he asks for games, **there** should **be** some limits. After all, Eddy is only a teacher with **a limitted** salary. Eddy is doing well in stopping Junior **from** buying too many new games.

> Corrections:

1. **"there should be"** is correct, but was split awkwardly — fixed for clarity.
2. **"limitted"** → should be **"limited"** (spelling error).

I don't think Eddy **is being** unfair to Junior. Junior is a kid, **so** when he **asks** for games, **there** should be some limits. After all, Eddy is only a teacher with **a limited salary**. Eddy is **doing well in** stopping Junior **from** buying **too many** new games.

我认为艾迪对朱尼尔并不不公平。朱尼尔还只是个孩子，所以在他要求玩游戏时，应该设定一些限制。毕竟艾迪只是个工资有限的老师。他在阻止朱尼尔买太多新游戏方面做得很好。

> Corrections:

1. "doing well in stopping" → awkward phrasing; more natural would be “right to stop” or “reasonable to stop.”
2. "there should be some limits" → grammatically okay, but “it’s reasonable to set limits” sounds more natural.
3. "a limited salary" → understandable, but more idiomatic would be “on a limited income” or “on a teacher’s salary.”

I don't think Eddy is being unfair to Junior. Junior is just a kid, so it's reasonable to **set some limits** when he asks for video games. After all, Eddy is a teacher and lives on a limited income. It's completely understandable that he doesn't want Junior to buy too many new games.
