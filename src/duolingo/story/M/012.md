# My Leg Hurts

Bea opens her front door. She sees Eddy standing on one leg.

- **Eddy**: My leg hurts. Can you **drive** me to the doctor’s office?
- **Bea**: Sure!

**Bea and Eddy get in Bea’s car.**

- **Eddy**: Wait! I forgot to pick up Junior from school. Can we go there?
- **Bea**: Of course.

**Bea and Eddy pick up Junior from school.**

- **Eddy**: Can we **also** go to the post office?
- **Bea**: But you hurt your leg, remember?
- **Eddy**: I need your help to pick up a large package.
- **Bea**: Ugh, fine.
- **Junior**: Look! There’s no line **at** Benny’s Burgers!

**Junior points at a restaurant.**

- **Eddy**: Their burgers are amazing, but the line is always so long! Let’s go!
- **Bea**: But you need to see a doctor!
- **Junior**: But there’s no line! It’s a **miracle**!

Later, Eddy, Junior, and Bea are in the restaurant.

- **Bea**: Wow, that burger was amazing.
- **Eddy**: Yeah, but we should go to the doctor’s office now.
- **Bea**: Does your leg still hurt?
- **Eddy**: No, my stomach hurts now. I think I ate **too many** burgers.
