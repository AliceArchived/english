# Mindfulness Towers - B3

Bea is sitting at her kitchen table, surrounded by tiny wooden blocks, tools, and papers. Eddy walks in with his gym bag.

- **Eddy**: Bea, what is all this? Are you building… a tower?
- **Bea**: Not just any tower, Eddy! I'm designing mindfulness towers! Look at this one. It has tiny hidden compartments for affirmations.
- **Eddy**: Uh, wow. But… why?
- **Bea**: It's about mindfulness. You pull out a block, read a motivational quote, and feel better. It's art and inspiration combined!
- **Eddy**: Looks hard. How long does it take?
- **Bea**: This one took six hours. But isn't it beautiful?
- **Eddy**: Sure… but six hours for a block tower?

Eddy **shrugs** and **pulls** a piece of plain wood from his gym bag.

- **Eddy**: Junior needed a **paperweight** for his desk, so I made this. Just carved it. What do you think?
- **Bea**: Eddy, that's just a block of wood! No compartments? No design?
- **Eddy**: Nope. But it gets the job done.

A few days later, Eddy comes back, grinning.

- **Eddy**: Bea! Guess what? Junior's teacher loved the block. She said all the kids want one now!
- **Bea**: What? They love that? But not my mindfulness towers?
- **Eddy**: I guess kids like simple things. You should make some!
- **Bea**: Simple? Eddy, I don't know how to be simple!
- **Eddy**: I can tell. Maybe I'll start a business. Eddy's Blocks. **Catchy**, right?
- **Bea**: **You're impossible.**

### 什么是 affirmations？

英文里的 **affirmation**（复数：affirmations），通常指的是一种正向、自我激励的句子，用来：

- 鼓励自己、
- 培养积极心态、
- 或在冥想、正念（mindfulness）中重复强化目标。

例如：

- “I am enough.”（我已经足够好了。）
- “I am calm and in control.”（我冷静而有掌控力。）

这些句子可能被写在纸条上、贴在镜子上，或藏在“正念塔”那种艺术装置的“隐藏隔层”中，每天拿出来念一念。

### 为什么翻译成“肯定语”感觉怪？

“肯定语”是直译（affirm + -ation），但在中文语境中它不常用，容易让人误解成语法上的“肯定句”。

### 更自然的翻译建议

根据语境，“affirmations” 更自然的中文翻译可以是：

- **正向语句**
- **自我鼓励语**
- **冥想语句**
- **每日正念语**
