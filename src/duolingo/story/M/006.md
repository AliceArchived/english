# Move the Bed

Zari is lying on Lily's bed. She's looking up at the ceiling.

- **Zari**: Lily, your room is boring. You should move your furniture.
- **Lily**: No. The room looks good now.
- **Zari**: I think your bed would look great in that corner.
- **Lily**: I do not.
- **Zari**: You know, it's really dangerous to have your bed next to the window.
- **Lily**: Dangerous?
- **Zari**: Lightning could hit that tree outside, and it could fall through your window.
  - Or a **murderer** could climb into your room.
- **Lily**: Wow, Zari. You've thought a lot about this.
- **Zari**: I'm trying to be a good friend, Lily. I want you to be safe.
- **Lily**: I'm fine. My bed has always been next to the window.
- **Zari**: Always? Then don't you want to try something new?
- **Lily**: You know I hate new things.
- **Zari**: Well .... I read a book once that said it's good to sleep with your head on the north side of your room.
- **Lily**: This is the north side of my room.
- **Zari**: Oh, did I say north side? I mean south side.
- **Lily**: Ugh, Zari! Why do you want me to move my bed?
- **Zari**: I think it will look so nice!
- **Lily**: Fine. Help me move it.

They start to move Lily's bed, but Lily sees something on the carpet...

- **Lily**: Zari, did you spill coffee on my carpet?
- **Zari**: Yes. But don't worry. You won't see it after we move your bed.
