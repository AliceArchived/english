# Movie Theater Memo - B2

Attention, Movie Theater Employees!

**Please be advised** that there have been several troublesome customers visiting our theater lately.

You should watch them closely because they are very **disruptive** and other customers have been complaining about them.

**Oscar - 40s, male, large mustache**

Under no circumstances should you talk to this guest. He will talk for hours about the artistic merits of films and criticize the choices of the directors.

If you can't get him to stop talking, use the secret signal you've been taught, and another employee will rescue you.

**Eddy - 30s, male, very muscular**

This man cries very loudly. If someone dies or falls in love in a movie, or if there is a puppy in danger, he will cry and bother everyone sitting around him.

His son, Junior, is usually able to quiet him down by feeding him snacks. For this reason, we recommend always giving Junior free nachos.

**Lin - 30s, female, cool jacket**

Be especially alert when Lin comes in.

She brings in her old soda cup to get free refills, and thus hasn't paid for a drink at this movie theater since 2014.

She's also been observed taking **handfuls** of popcorn from any stranger sitting next to her during **dimly** lit scenes.

Our lawyers say we cannot yet ban these customers from our theater just for being annoying. Regardless, all employees are encouraged to report their misbehavior to management immediately. (British: misbehaviour)

## Writing

### What do you think of Oscar, Eddy, and Lin's behavior?

I think their behavior pitch their personallys. Oscar is self-satisfied and like to ~~critise~~ everything related with art. Eddy is a sensitive guy, ~~easy to be~~ touched by almost everything. Lin is someone who likes to take little advantages.

I think their behavior reflects their **personalities**. Oscar is **self-satisfied** and **likes** to **criticize** everything related **to** art. Eddy is a sensitive guy, easily touched by almost everything. Lin is someone who likes to take little advantages.

> - "self-satisfied" is grammatically correct, but "self-satisfied **person**" or "a bit arrogant" may sound more natural.
> - "likes to criticize everything related to art" is okay but slightly awkward — "everything about art" is smoother.
> - "take little advantages" should be "take **small advantages**" or better: "**take advantage of small things**" or "**look for small gains**."

I think their behavior **reflects** their **personalities**. Oscar is **self-satisfied** and likes to **criticize everything about art**. Eddy is a sensitive guy, easily touched by almost everything. Lin is someone who likes to **take advantage of small things**.
