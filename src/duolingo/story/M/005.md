# Monster Under the Bed

It's late at night. Junior is in his bed, but he can't sleep.

- **Junior**: Dad! There's a monster under my bed! I need you!

Eddy runs to Junior's bedroom.

- **Eddy**: It's OK, Junior. Let me look. If I see a monster, then I'll make him leave.
- **Junior**: Thanks, Dad.

Eddy looks under the bed.

- **Eddy**: I don't see any monsters, so it's safe to go to sleep.
- **Junior**: I can't sleep! Maybe the monster is hiding!

Eddy starts to **crawl** under the bed.

- **Eddy**: There isn't a lot of space down here. I don't know if I'll fit, Junior.
- **Junior**: Please! I'm scared!

Eddy crawls further under the bed.

- **Eddy**: Hello? Monster? Are you hiding?
  - No, Junior, the monster is gone!
- **Junior**: Thanks, Dad.

Eddy tries to crawl out **from under the bed**.

- **Eddy**: Um ... Junior? I think I'm stuck.
- **Junior**: Uh-oh. Let me help you!

Junior tries to lift the bed.

- **Junior**: Ugh… the bed is too heavy! Let me try to pull you out.

Junior pulls Eddy's legs.

- **Junior**: Oh no, Dad... you're **really stuck**!
- **Eddy**: Can you pull harder?
- **Junior**: This is hard work. I'm tired.
  - I'm going to lie down, OK?
- **Eddy**: Maybe if I move my head, then I can get out...
  - Or maybe if I turn my shoulders...
  - I think it's working! Junior, can you **reach** my legs and pull?
  - Junior? Junior?

Junior has fallen asleep. He begins to **snore**.

- **Eddy**: Ah, OK.
  - I'll just sleep here...

Eddy closes his eyes.

- **Eddy**: Goodnight, Junior.

## Writing

### Did you like this story? Why or why not?

No, I didn't like this story. What does this story mean? Did the author try to tell a funny story? It's not funny. Or is it funny in English culture?

> - **“What does this story mean?”** 在这里重复发问，语气略显突兀；上下文已经表达了不喜欢，可以合并表达疑惑的原因。
> - **“Or is it funny in English culture?”** 更自然的说法是 “Maybe it's considered funny in English culture?” 更礼貌、连贯。

No, I didn't like this story. **I'm not sure what the story means**. **Was** the author trying to **be funny**? I didn't **find** it funny. Maybe it's considered funny in English culture?

不，我不喜欢这个故事。我不太确定这个故事的含义。作者是想讲个笑话吗？我觉得一点也不好笑。也许在英语文化中，这样的故事被认为是有趣的？
