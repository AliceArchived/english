# Museum of Doom - B2

A Review

Like most readers of the Intellectual Journal, I have always seen video games as an **obnoxious** waste of time.

However, a young friend recently introduced me to Museum of Doom, and it was so delightful that I had to rethink everything I knew about video games.

In Museum of Doom, players are trapped in a haunted museum, and they must fight ghosts of famous artists, and paintings that have come to life.

In spite of the ridiculous concept, I've come to see that this game is both entertaining and educational.

Some have said that Museum of Doom **glorifies** unnecessary violence, but that's completely untrue! It's actually a lesson in art history!

When Picasso tells a player he's going to "rearrange" their face, he's not only threatening them, he's teaching players about his **groundbreaking** **Cubist** technique.

Unfortunately, my review only covers the first half of the game. To date, I have not gotten past the level of Hokusai's The Great Wave.

I've tried to swim through the wave, but the current carries me away every time, and then I **drown**.

I hope to beat this level soon because I've heard that, in the next level, players have to avoid being melted by Salvador Dali!

Museum of Doom shows that, on occasion, video games can be fun and educational.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go watch a video tutorial on how to swim through The Great Wave.
