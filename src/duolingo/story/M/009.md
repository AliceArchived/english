# My Ex's Wedding - B2

Eddy and his friend Bea are at a fancy wedding **reception**. Eddy leans over to Bea and whispers.

- **Eddy**: Thanks again for coming with me. I thought it would look **pathetic** if I came to my ex-girlfriend's wedding alone.
- **Bea**: Trust me, I understand.

Eddy looks at the bride sadly.

- **Eddy**: She looks amazing. How could I have broken up with her? We were a great couple!
- **Bea**: Uh… I remember that relationship, and I think you're only remembering the good times.

Eddy starts crying.

- **Eddy**: No, Georgia was incredible. I made a huge mistake, and now I'll never find true love again.

Eddy continues crying softly as Bea lightly touches his shoulder.

- **Bea**: Weddings have a weird effect on you.

At the front of the room, the bride stands to give a speech.

- **Georgia**: I met the groom for the first time while playing golf…

Eddy wipes his tears with a tissue.

- **Eddy**: I never understood her **obsession** with golf. It's the most boring sport.
- **Bea**: It is pretty slow.
- **Eddy**: Yeah, it doesn't even involve running, which is the best part of any sport!

The bride continues with her speech.

- **Georgia**: We realized we were perfect **for** each other because we both travel so much. (~~to~~)

Eddy looks disappointed **as** he listens.

- **Eddy**: That's right —she was **constantly** traveling. I had Junior, so I couldn't go with her. She never understood that.
  - She never understood me…

As Georgia finishes her speech, the crowd claps. Bea turns to Eddy.

- **Bea**: So do you still think you made the wrong decision **with** Georgia?
- **Eddy**: No. I'd rather be with someone who understands me.
- **Bea**: Let's get out of here and go for a run.
- **Eddy**: I'll **race you to** the car!

## Writing

### Do you think Eddy and Georgia should've stayed together? Why or why not?

I think that Eddy and Georgia should not stay together. They don't share the same values, so they can't understand each other. They are totally different people.

我认为 Eddy 和 Georgia 不应该在一起。他们没有共同的价值观，所以无法理解彼此。他们完全是两个不同的人。

---

I think that Eddy and Georgia shouldn't have stayed together. They have **totally** different **personalities**; they **enjoy** different sports; and they don’t seem to care about each other.

---

I think that Eddy and Georgia should not **have stayed** together. They had different hobbies, and they could not understand each other.

我认为 Eddy 和 Georgia 不应该继续在一起。他们兴趣不同，也无法理解彼此。

---

一个自然流畅的重写版本：

I do not think Eddy and Georgia should have stayed together. They had very different lifestyles and priorities. Georgia was always traveling and loved golf, while Eddy had to take care of Junior and never liked golf at all. They did not really understand each other, and that is important in a relationship.

我认为 Eddy 和 Georgia 不应该继续在一起。他们的生活方式和重心完全不同。Georgia 经常旅行，而且热爱高尔夫，而 Eddy 需要照顾 Junior，而且根本不喜欢高尔夫。他们并不真正理解对方，而理解在一段关系中是非常重要的。
