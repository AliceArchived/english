# Romantic Getway - B2

Vikram - 3 days ago

4/5 stars

Recently, my wife, Priti, and I stayed at the Red Rose for **a romantic getaway**.

I wasn't planning on **writing** about our experience, but the manager begged me to leave a positive review.

While hotel rooms are usually private, ours came with an extra guest.

When we checked into our room, we found another person sitting on the bed.

It turned out the hotel made a mistake and put another guest in the same room.

Reception told us that there were no other rooms available, so Carlos let my wife and I stay on the couch. It turned out that Carlos also loved watching "The Great Baking Show," so at least I made a new friend!

At every other hotel where we've stayed, the heat worked. But that wasn't the case at The Red Rose.

I caught the flu after one night in our freezing room, but luckily my fever kept my wife warm the rest of our stay!

On our last morning at the hotel, we decided to order room service.

Unfortunately, our pancakes were delivered to the room next door.

When we requested another breakfast, it was also delivered to the room next door. This hotel has very thin walls, so we were able to hear our neighbors enjoying it. It sounded delicious!

What an unforgettable experience!

The rest of our vacation was boring compared to our stay at The Red Rose.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**What do you think of Vikram's review? Would you stay at The Red Rose?**

Honestly, I think Vikram **made a real effort** to say something **nice** about the hotel. But **when** the place is **that** bad, it’s hard to be **both honest and positive**. I definitely wouldn’t stay at The Red Rose — it sounds like a terrible place.

说实话，我觉得 Vikram 确实尽力说了一些好话。但如果酒店真的那么糟糕，要做到既诚实又积极就很难了。我肯定不会住在 The Red Rose ——听起来是个非常糟糕的地方。

### Practice History

**What do you think of Vikram's review? Would you stay at The Red Rose?**

In my opinion, Vikram really tried his best to write positive comments about this hotel. However, the hotel is really bad, it's almost impossible for you to be honest and positive at the same time. And I would never stay at The Red Rose — it is really a bad hotel.

> Corrections:

1.  “the hotel is really bad, it's almost impossible…” → should be separated into two sentences or joined with an em dash to improve clarity.
2.  “for you to be honest” → more natural as “to be honest.”
3.  “really a bad hotel” → stronger and more natural as “truly a terrible hotel.”

In my opinion, Vikram really tried his best to write positive comments about the hotel. However, the hotel is really bad — it’s almost impossible **to be honest** and positive at the same time. I would never stay at The Red Rose — it’s **truly** a terrible hotel.

在我看来，Vikram 真的尽力为这家酒店写出一些积极的评论。但这家酒店实在太糟了，几乎不可能一边诚实一边又说好话。我绝不会住在 The Red Rose ——这家酒店真的很差。

In my opinion, I won't stay at the Red Rose. It has **a** management problem. If only one thing **happens**, it could **happen**, but if a series of things **happens**, it must have big issues with the management.

> Corrections:

1. "It has **a** management problem" is okay, but “**a**” sounds too mild; “**has management problems**” is more natural.
2. The verb agreement is inconsistent: “if only one thing **happens**, it could **happen**” — the second “happen” is vague and repetitive.
3. “a series of things **happens**” → should be **happen** (plural subject).

In my opinion, I won't stay at the Red Rose. It has **management problems**. If only one thing **went wrong**, it might be a **coincidence**. But if a series of things **happen**, there must be serious issues with the management.

In my opinion, it's a really bad hotel. It always ~~says~~, when you find a bug in a room, ~~it~~ is always more than one, nevertheless there were a ~~serious~~ of problems. There are huge management problem with this hotel.

In my opinion, it's a really bad hotel. It **always seems** that when you find a bug in a room, there is always more than one; nevertheless, there were a **series** of **problems**. There are huge management problems with this hotel.

> Corrections:

1. **"a series of problems"** 是复数概念，应搭配复数动词，而非 "there was"（但你句子用了 “there were”，这是对的）。
2. **主句时态、逻辑基本通顺，但 "always seems that" 结构略显不自然，可稍作调整使语言更地道。**

Correct:

In my opinion, it's a really bad hotel. It always seems **like** when you find a bug in a room, there is always more than one; nevertheless, there were a series of problems. There are huge management problems with this hotel.

Better version:

In my opinion, it's a really bad hotel. **Whenever** you find a bug in a room, **there always seems to be** more than one. **On top of that**, there were a series of problems. The hotel **suffers from** major management issues.
