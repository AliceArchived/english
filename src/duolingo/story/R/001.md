# Remember Me? - B2

Eddy is with his friend Bea at a cafe when he notices a woman.

- **Eddy**: Oh no!
- **Bea**: What's the matter?

Eddy hides behind his menu.

- **Eddy**: That's Amy!
- **Bea**: Who?
- **Eddy**: She was the coolest girl in my high school. I was in love with her, but she only dated athletes.
- **Bea**: You weren't an athlete?
- **Eddy**: No, I was **skinny** and **awkward**!
- **Bea**: But you've changed so much. She might be interested now. Go talk to her!
- **Eddy**: No way! She's going to reject me. Unless she showed interest, I wouldn't ask her out.
- **Bea**: You'll never know if she's interested unless you talk to her.
- **Eddy**: Well, I have changed a lot since school ... I'm fit, and I have a real job!
  - I'll talk to her. Wish me luck!

Eddy takes a deep breath and approaches Amy.

- **Eddy**: Hello there, Amy.
- **Amy**: Hi ... Do I know you?
- **Eddy**: It's me, Eddy! We went to the same school.
  - Don't you remember? We watched so many movies together.
- **Amy**: Oh yes! You cried during **romcoms**, even the one with the dogs who fell in love.
- **Eddy**: I just wanted what those dogs had - true love.
- **Amy**: I didn't recognize you at all. You're so ... **muscular** now.

Eddy blushes.

- **Eddy**: You know ... I always had a big crush on you.
- **Amy**: Really? I had no idea!
- **Eddy**: And now you're here. It's so nice to see you!
  - So, will you go out with me, Amy?

A few minutes later, Bea sees Eddy returning to their table. He's **grinning**.

- **Eddy**: This is the best day ever!
- **Bea**: She actually said yes?! So when are you going out with her?
- **Eddy**: Never! She's happily married with two kids.
- **Bea**: Then why are you so happy?
- **Eddy**: Because she told me she had **a crush on** me in school too!

## Sentences

- 是啊！你在看浪漫喜剧时都会哭，连那部讲两只狗相爱都让你哭了。
  - Oh yes! You cried during **romcoms**, even the one with the dogs who fell in love.
  - "Romcoms" is an abbreviation for "romantic comedies," which are movies or shows that focus on humor and romance.
- 我只想要那些狗拥有的东西——真正的爱情。
  - I just wanted what those dogs had - true love.
- 绝不可能！她已经结婚，而且还有两个孩子。
  - Never! She's happily married with two kids.
  - The correct form is **"She is happily married with two kids."** The verb **"is"** is used because "married" functions as an adjective describing her current state.

## Writing

### Eddy was really brave! Would you do the same if you saw your high school crush?

No, I would not do the same thing. First, I don't have any high school ~~crash~~, second, even if I had a high school crash, I would not tell the guy. Past is past, I only look forward to the future.

No, I would not do the same thing. First, I don't have any high school **crush**, and even if I had **one**, I would not tell the guy. **The past** is past, I only look forward to the future.

1. "any high school **crush**" → "crush" is singular, but “any” usually pairs with plural; better to say “I didn’t have a high school crush.”
2. "even if I had **one**" is acceptable, but smoother as "even if I did."
3. "The past is past" → grammatically okay but better phrased as "The past is the past."

No, I would not do the same thing. First, I didn’t have **a** high school **crush**, and even if I did, I wouldn’t tell the guy. **The past is the past**—I only look forward to the future.
