# Removing Tough Stains

Eddy's Advice Column

Hello, friends!

I'm Eddy. Today, the question is, 'How do I remove the toughest stain?' Believe me, I understand the struggle! I'm always dealing with a tough stain or two, especially with Junior around. But don't worry, I have some ideas that might work. Here's what you can do:

**Use the Right Tools**

First, you need a good stain remover. Something powerful. It's a good thing Junior isn't in charge of cleaning, or he'd probably use **ketchup**! Be cautious and choose a remover that is designed for the toughest stains. Just check the label to be sure.

**Act Fast**

Timing is everything! As soon as you see the stain, take action. It's best to handle it right away. The longer the stain sits, the tougher it becomes. I learned this the hard way when Junior spilled juice on my new shorts. That juice stained them forever!

**Try a Homemade Solution**

If you run out of stain remover, don't worry! A homemade mix of vinegar and baking soda can save the day! But be warned, it may smell like a science experiment. Junior loves to help with this part and insists on being the "official mixer" in our house.

With my tips, you can tackle the toughest stains and keep your clothes looking fresh!

Good luck!

去除顽固污渍

Eddy 的建议专栏

大家好！

我是 Eddy。今天的问题是：“我该如何去除最顽固的污渍？”相信我，我懂得这种痛苦！我经常要处理一两个顽固污渍，尤其是 Junior 在家的时候。但别担心，我有一些可能有效的方法。你可以试试以下这些：

**使用合适的工具**

首先，你需要一个好的去渍产品，要够强力。幸好 Junior 不负责清洁，不然他可能会用**番茄酱**呢！请小心选择，找那种专门针对顽固污渍的去渍剂。记得查看标签确认。

**迅速行动**

时间就是一切！一发现污渍就要马上处理。越早处理越好，污渍放得越久就越难清理。我是被 Junior 把果汁洒在我新短裤上后才学到这个教训的。那果汁把短裤永远染上了！

**尝试自制溶液**

如果你的去渍剂用完了，别慌！醋和小苏打混合的自制配方可以拯救你！不过要提醒一下，它闻起来可能像科学实验。Junior 特别喜欢帮忙，还坚持当我们家的“官方搅拌员”。

有了我的小贴士，你可以**战胜**最顽固的污渍，让衣物焕然一新！

祝好运！

**Which of Eddy's tips seems most useful to you?**

I think Eddy’s advice **on** timing is the most useful tip for me. In the past, I’ve had to deal with tough stains, and I noticed that the faster I acted, the easier it was to clean them. In my opinion, timing plays a crucial role in stain removal — more than the cleaning product itself. After all, most of us already have **basic cleaning supplies** at hand. It’s really about acting fast before the stain has time to **set**.

我认为 Eddy 关于“掌握时机”的建议对我来说是最实用的。过去我也处理过一些顽固污渍，我发现越早动手清理，效果越好。在我看来，去污的关键在于时间的把握，而不只是使用什么清洁产品。毕竟我们大多数人身边已经有基础的清洁用品。真正重要的是在污渍固定之前迅速处理。

Helpful Phrase: I think / Eddy's advice on/ In my opinion

I think Eddy's advice on timing is the most useful tip for me. I've experienced some stains, and in my opinion, timing is the most important aspect when you want to remove stains — after all, we all have cleaning products **at** hand.

> Corrections:

1. Sentence is grammatically sound, but using "experienced some stains" sounds slightly awkward. A more natural phrase might be “dealt with stubborn stains” or “had to clean tough stains.”

I think Eddy's advice on timing is the most useful tip for me. **I've had to deal with** tough stains before, and in my opinion, timing is the most important aspect when you want to remove stains — after all, we all have cleaning products at hand.

我认为 Eddy 关于“时机”的建议对我来说最有用。我之前也处理过一些顽固污渍，在我看来，清除污渍时，时机是最关键的因素——毕竟，我们手边总是有清洁用品。
