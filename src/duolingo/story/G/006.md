# Ghost Hunting Log - B2

Job: #4

Date and time: May 10th at 10 p.m.

Client: Mrs. Henderson

Location: 136 Maple Avenue

Last week, Lily and I got a call from a lady who was worried her house was haunted. Based on my research from teen romance novels, I knew we'd probably find the ghosts of two lovers separated by their disapproving families.

When we arrived, I announced to any ghosts who might be listening that we were there to help them find true love.

Lily warned me to watch out for **portals** to other dimensions.

Then I saw the most terrifying thing I'd ever seen: a framed photo of Troy Henderson, the most popular boy in school! I realized that we were in his house!

I screamed, and Lily immediately turned on our ghost-catching machine, which is also my dad's vacuum.

A door flew open, and there was Troy!

"Zari? Why are you vacuuming my house in the middle of the night?" he asked.

Before I could make something up, Lily answered: "We're hunting ghosts, duh."

In that moment, I was so embarrassed I wanted to find a portal to another dimension.

But instead of laughing at us, Troy hugged us!

"I'm so happy you're here!" he said. "I'm terrified of ghosts!"

I smiled with relief and told him we'd have to come back once a week to keep the ghosts away. I was thrilled to have a dreamy new customer!

## Writing

### What did Zari write about in her log?

In Zari's log, she recorded her business case, and that case was actually in the house, which was Troy's home. At first, Zari was embarrassed. She was afraid to leave Troy a bad impression because she has a crush on him. However Troy was happy to see her and gave good comments **on** her job.

> 1. “**recorded her business case**” → 表达不太自然，建议改为 “**she wrote about a business case**” 或 “**she documented her business assignment**”。
> 2. “**and that case was actually in the house**” → 句子结构不清晰，建议改为 “which turned out to be located in Troy’s house”。
> 3. “**because she has a crush on him**” → 时态错误，应为 **“she had a crush on him”**（故事发生在过去）。
> 4. “**gave good comments on her job**” → 更自然表达是 **“gave her positive feedback on her work”**。

In Zari's log, she **wrote about** a business case, which **turned out** to be located in Troy’s house. At first, Zari felt embarrassed because she had **a crush on** Troy and didn’t want to leave a bad impression. However, Troy was happy to see her and **gave her positive feedback** on her work.

在 Zari 的日志中，她写下了一个商业案例，结果那个案例就发生在 Troy 的家里。一开始，Zari 感到很尴尬，因为她暗恋 Troy，不想给他留下坏印象。不过，Troy 见到她很高兴，还对她的工作给予了积极评价。

**[Rewritten Answer]**
In her log, Zari wrote about a ghost-hunting job she did with Lily at a house that turned out to belong to Troy, the most popular boy at school. At first, Zari was embarrassed to be caught vacuuming his house in the middle of the night, especially because she has a crush on him. But to her surprise, Troy was happy to see them and even said he was scared of ghosts. Zari ended the log feeling excited to have Troy as a new customer.

**[Chinese]**
在她的日志中，扎丽记录了一次和莉莉一起猎鬼的经历。她们去了一个房子，结果发现那竟然是校内最受欢迎的男生特洛伊的家。刚开始，扎丽因为半夜在他家吸地而感到非常尴尬，尤其是她还暗恋特洛伊。但出乎意料的是，特洛伊很高兴见到她们，还说自己很怕鬼。最后，扎丽为能拥有这么梦幻的新客户而感到兴奋。

### **Describe something interesting you wrote about or read in a journal or log.**

**[Part 2 Sample Answer]**
One of the most interesting logs I’ve read recently was written by a girl named Zari. It was part of a story where she and her friend Lily **took on a ghost-hunting job**. In her log, Zari described going to a house where strange things were **happening**. She expected to find the spirits of two lovers, like in the romance novels she had read. But things **took** an unexpected **turn**.

When she and Lily arrived at the house, Zari realized, to her horror, that it actually belonged to Troy, the most popular boy at her school—and also the boy she secretly had a crush on. She was **mortified** to be caught vacuuming his house in the middle of the night, especially since their ghost-catching machine was really just her dad’s vacuum cleaner.

Surprisingly, instead of laughing at them, Troy was actually **thrilled** to see them. He **admitted** that he was terrified of ghosts and even gave them a hug. Zari was so relieved and excited that she ended her log by saying she would have to come back once a week to “keep the ghosts away,” clearly happy that Troy was now her first real customer.

I found her log funny, creative, and very **relatable**. It showed how something embarrassing can turn into a great memory—and possibly even the start of something more.

**[Chinese]**
我最近读到的一篇很有趣的日志是一个叫扎丽的女孩写的。她和朋友莉莉接了一次“猎鬼任务”，并在日志中记录了整个经历。她原本以为会遇到像小说中那种被家庭拆散的幽灵情侣，但事情却发生了意想不到的变化。

她们到达目的地后，扎丽发现那竟然是她暗恋的校草特洛伊的家，这让她当场吓坏了。更糟糕的是，她正在用她爸的吸尘器“捉鬼”，场面十分尴尬。

不过没想到，特洛伊并没有嘲笑她们，反而非常高兴地表示他害怕鬼，并且还给了她们一个拥抱。扎丽在日志最后写道她要每周回来一次“驱鬼”，显然是很高兴能拥有这样一个梦幻的新客户。

我觉得这篇日志又搞笑又有创意，还很真实。它让我觉得，即使是尴尬的经历，有时也能变成美好的回忆，甚至是一段故事的开始。

**take on** vs **take**

1. **take on**（更完整、更自然）

   - **含义**：承担、接受（某项任务、责任、挑战）

   - **语气**：更正式、有“主动承担某事”的语气

   - **用法**：适合描述**工作、任务、项目、挑战等**

_Zari and Lily **took on** a ghost-hunting job._
→ 她们主动接受了这项猎鬼任务（强调“承担挑战”）。

2. **take**（简单接受/拿到）

   - **含义**：接受、选择、拿到

   - **语气**：中性，更普通

   - **更常用于**课程（take a class）、药物（take medicine）等

❌ _Zari **took** a ghost-hunting job_
→ 虽然语法上可以，但**语气不够自然**，尤其用于任务或工作时，**缺少“主动应战”的感觉**。

| **take a class**        | 上一门课     | I'm taking a math class this semester.              |

> 结论：
> 在描述 “猎鬼任务” 这种带有主动行动、挑战性的场景时，
> “take on a ghost-hunting job” 更地道、更有画面感。

But things took an unexpected turn.

为什么不能说 “But things took an unexpected.”
这是不完整的句子，因为：

- “unexpected” 是形容词，后面必须修饰名词。
- “take” 在这里是动词，后面必须接一个名词宾语（take + something）。

“take an unexpected” ← 错误，因为缺少名词
✅ 正确的是：
“take an unexpected turn” ✅

“take a turn” 是固定搭配： take a turn = 情况发生变化

- “an unexpected turn” = 一个意想不到的转折 / 变化

| Things took a dark turn.                | 情况突然变糟了。           |
| Their conversation took a serious turn. | 他们的谈话变得严肃起来。   |
| The trip took an unexpected turn.       | 这次旅行出现了意外的变化。 |
