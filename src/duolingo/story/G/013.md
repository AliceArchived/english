# Gum, Microwave, Keychain - B3

Lin, Joined 2009

Items Sold: 573

Hey there! Today, I went through my apartment and found some **gems** that I'm sure someone out there is longing for. They might have been abandoned, but they deserve a second chance. This is what I have today:

**Old Gum Collection - 2 dollars**

Yes, you heard right — an old gum collection! I found these under my bed. I can't believe they were there for so long. I think they're older than me! If you're an artist, you can use them for a sculpture. Or, make a wish and chew some "vintage" gum!

**Burnt Microwave - Free**

Before you ask, no, it wasn't me who burnt this microwave! There must be a secret cooking method I don't know about. It still looks kind of cool, like a modern art piece. Place it in your kitchen, and people will never know it doesn't work.

**Broken Keychain - 1 dollar**

Do you collect keychains? This one has been through a lot, and a piece is missing, but it's still shiny! I think it used to belong to my friend Bea. She always keeps her keys in order. Maybe you can fix it or keep it as a small decoration. It's sure to start a conversation!

That's all I have today!

Call, text, or email me!

## Sentences

- Hey there! Today, I went through my apartment and found some **gems** that I'm sure someone out there is longing for.
  - “Gems” is used metaphorically. It doesn’t mean actual jewels — it means valuable, interesting, or unique items that the speaker considers special despite their appearance or condition.
- 这肯定会引发一场对话！
  - It's sure to start a conversation!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Which item do you find most interesting? Why?**

I think the keychain is the most interesting item. **At the very least**, it can be used as a decoration, so it has some value. On the other hand, I find the old gum quite disgusting — I really don’t understand why anyone would keep that.

我觉得钥匙链是最有趣的物品。至少它可以当作一个装饰品，还有点价值。相比之下，我觉得那些旧口香糖真的很恶心 — 我实在不明白为什么有人会把那种东西留下来。

### Practice History

**Which item do you find most interesting? Why?**

I think/ The most interesting is/ I find

I think the most interesting item should be the keychain. I find it can at least be a decoration. For old gums, I think those are **disgusting**.

> Corrections:

1. “should be” → 改为 “is” 更自然，表达更坚定、地道
2. “can at least be” → 改为 “useful at least as” 更准确地表达“至少可以作为…”的意思
3. “those are disgusting” → “it’s pretty disgusting” 因为 **“gum” 在这里不可数**，且加上 “pretty” 增强口语色彩
4. 调整句式使语义清晰，并添加衔接词 “as for” 增强流畅度

I think the most interesting item **is** the keychain. I find it **useful** at least **as** a decoration. **As for** the old gum, I think **it’s** pretty disgusting.

我觉得最有趣的物品是钥匙链。我觉得它至少可以当装饰品。而那些旧口香糖，我觉得挺恶心的。
