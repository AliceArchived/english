- **Zari runs to Lily in the hall at school**
- Zari: Lily, I have a problem.
- Lily: Zari, for the last time, it's OK **if you don't get a perfect grade**!
- Zari: No, I think Enzo is in love with me.
- Lily: Enzo? The student visiting from Italy?
- Zari: Yes, I think he's going to ask me **to visit** him **in** Rome.
- Lily: Really?
- Zari: Then we'll get married!
  - We'll have an apartment with **a great view** of the **Colosseum**.
  - And we'll have a **scooter** and a cat named Fellini!
- Lily: Wow, that's a … **detailed plan**.
- Zari: But now I need to tell my parents …
- Lily: Zari… why do you think that he wants you to go to Rome?
- Zari: He said very **romantic** things to me.
- Lily: Really?
