# Get Well Soon - B2

From: eddy@duomail.co

To: oscar@duomail.co

**Subject: Tuesday Update**

Dear Oscar,

Everyone at school misses you while you're home with a broken foot! I'm just writing to update you on everything that's been happening at school.

The principal has hired a great **substitute** teacher for your art classes.

She doesn't give any instructions because she says structure destroys creativity. It's funny because that's the exact **opposite** of what you always say!

The kids say art is now their favorite class. I'm sure you're thrilled they finally love the class they used to find boring!

Also, some great news! You have a new parking spot, and it's in the back of the **parking lot**, right next to mine!

Now we can have a nice long walk together from our cars every morning — and it'll be especially long because you'll be using **crutches**.

The school gave your old parking spot to Mrs. Smith because she's pregnant. They wanted her to have the best spot in the parking lot — the one closest to the school! Isn't that nice?!

You're usually too busy to talk to me, but now we'll finally have time to hang out!

Anyway, I'm sending you this email so I won't forget to share these important details with you.

I'll tell you more when I visit you later today, like I do every day! I know you keep telling me to stop coming, but I can tell you're just being polite. See you soon!

Your best buddy,

Eddy

## Writing

### Do you think Oscar will be happy with these updates? Why or why not?

From my point of view, Oscar will not happy with these updates. Actually, every news are bad news for Oscar. His parking spot was assigned to other teacher so he must use a farther one. Students were instructed by someone who has totally opposite teaching principles with Oscar, and students liked this new teacher more.

From my point of view, Oscar will not **be** happy with these updates. Actually, every **piece of** news **is** bad news for Oscar. His parking spot was assigned to **another** teacher so he must use a farther one. Students were instructed by someone who has totally opposite teaching **principles** **to** Oscar, and students liked this new teacher **more**.

> - “Oscar will not **be** happy” 虽然语法对，但正式写作中更自然的是 “Oscar **won’t** be happy”。
> - “every **piece of** news **is** bad news” 是对的，但 “actually” 开头略显口语，可换成 “in fact” 或去掉。
> - “principles **to** Oscar” 应为 “principles **from** Oscar” 或 “principles that are completely different **from** Oscar's”。
> - “liked this new teacher **more**” 可更清晰地表达为 “liked the new teacher better than Oscar”。

From my point of view, Oscar **won’t be** happy with these updates. In fact, **every piece of news** is bad news for him. His parking spot was assigned to another teacher, so he has to use **a more distant** one. **The students** were instructed by someone **whose teaching principles** are completely different from Oscar’s, and they **liked** the new teacher **better than** him.

在我看来，奥斯卡不会对这些更新感到高兴。实际上，这些消息对他来说全是坏消息。他的停车位被分配给了另一位老师，因此他必须使用更远的车位。学生们则由一位教学理念与奥斯卡完全不同的老师授课，而且他们更喜欢这位新老师。

为什么 “opposite principles to Oscar” 是错的？

这是因为：

- **“Opposite” 通常不直接接 “to + 人”**。
- 你想表达的是：这些**教学理念**与奥斯卡的**完全相反**。
- **教学理念**之间相对，不能直接和“人”对比。应该是和**奥斯卡的教学理念**对比。

| 错误表达                                  | 原因                         | 正确替换                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| opposite teaching principles **to Oscar** | 错在“opposite”不能和“人”比较 | **opposite to Oscar’s (principles)**             |
| opposite **to** Oscar                     | “人”不适合作为比较对象       | different from Oscar’s methods                   |
| principles opposite **to Oscar**          | 语义不完整、不精确           | principles completely **different from Oscar’s** |

**opposite to**：用于物体/方向，如：

- _The bank is opposite to the post office._（对面）

**opposite of**：用于抽象概念：

- _His beliefs are the opposite of mine._

...someone **whose teaching principles are completely different from Oscar’s.**

一个教学理念和奥斯卡**完全相反**的人。

你的回答的改写版本

I don’t think Oscar will be happy with these updates. **Even though** Eddy seems **excited**, everything he **shares** sounds like bad news for Oscar. His parking spot was taken and moved farther away, he now has to walk on crutches, and his students prefer the new **substitute teacher** who teaches the exact opposite of how he does. **On top of that**, Eddy keeps visiting Oscar every day, even though Oscar clearly wants him to stop.

我认为奥斯卡不会对这些消息感到高兴。尽管 Eddy 听起来很兴奋，但他说的每一件事对奥斯卡来说几乎都是坏消息。他的停车位被换成了更远的，他现在还得拄拐走很长一段路；他的学生们更喜欢新来的代课老师，而那位老师的教学方式和他完全相反。而且，埃迪每天都去看他，尽管奥斯卡已经明确表示不想他再来。
