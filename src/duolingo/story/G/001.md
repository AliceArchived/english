# Get Back Together - B2

Dear Twenty-Two,

My name is Lily, and my best friend Zari, loves your band's music. I think your music is unoriginal and you sound like a hundred other bands, but Zari is really sad that you broke up. She's acting **weird**, and I hate it.

Based on what I've heard when Zari forces me to listen to your music, I assume your band broke up because you hate listening to each other sing.

Nonetheless, you have to get back together.

I showed Zari a picture of a penguin riding an escalator yesterday, and she didn't even smile.

Additionally, our teachers and classmates have noticed Zari acting differently, and they keep asking me about it. It's horrible because I **despise** talking to people.

Believe me, there's nothing I want more than for each of you to attempt a solo career, realize you have no talent, try to become actors, and then fail at that too.

However, you need to forget about your pride and get back onstage. If you don't, I'm afraid I'll have no choice but do do something embarrassing to try to cheer her up, and I'll never recover from that.

In conclusion, you need to get back together right now. Got it? If it helps, I think your one song about how love is pointless is kind of OK.

Not a fan,

Lily
