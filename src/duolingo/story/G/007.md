# Girl Band

Eddy and his son, Junior, are at a concert for the pop band, Hot Pink.

While Eddy is watching the show, a man comes to talk to him.

- **man**: Can you believe we have to come to these concert**s** with our kids?
- **Eddy**: I know, isn't it awesome? This band is visiting all the way from Japan.
- **man**: All of their songs sound the same.
- **Eddy**: But they're all such good dancers!

Eddy starts dancing.

- **man**: Wow, you know all of their dance **moves**.

Eddy waves his arms in the air.

- **Eddy**: Yeah! I practice with Junior all the time.
- **man**: Your daughter's name is Junior?
- **Eddy**: Oh no, Junior is my son! This is his favorite band!
- **man**: But this band is for girls. I'm here with my daughter.
- **Eddy**: I think this music is for everyone!

Junior runs over to Eddy.

- **Junior**: Look, Dad, the band signed my shirt!
- **Eddy**: That's so cool, Junior! Maybe they'll sign mine too.

A new song starts, and Junior and Eddy begin dancing again.

Eddy sees the man tapping his foot to the music.

- **Eddy**: It's OK, you can say it. You like this band too.
- **Man**: No â€¦
  - I just like this one song.
