# Getting Kids to Clean - B3

Eddy's Advice Column

Hello, friends!

I'm Eddy. Today, the question is, 'How can I get my children to clean up?' It's not easy, but I have some ideas. I'm a dad, and I have tried many things to get my son, Junior, to clean up. Here's what you can do:

**Make Cleaning A Game**

Turn cleaning up into a game. Your children won't mind, will they? You can set a timer and say, "Let's see who can clean up the fastest!" The winner gets a hug or maybe some candy. Junior loves this, and **sometimes** he even cleans up everything!

**Use A Surprise Box**

Create a surprise box! Put toys or snacks inside and tell your children that if they clean up their things, they get to see what's inside the box. It's almost like a treasure hunt. Junior gets really excited about this, it's fun for both of us!

**Lead By Example**

Show them how it's done. Clean up with them and make it fun! Put on some music and dance while you clean up. I like to do this in my red sweatsuit. It's not high fashion, but it's fun, isn't it? Your children will start to enjoy cleaning together.

With these tips, cleaning up can be easy and fun!

Stay strong!

It’s such a smart way to make kids feel excited about doing chores. Instead of seeing cleaning as something boring, they now think of it as a game. Eddy's idea doesn’t just make the house tidier — it also helps children build responsibility while having fun. I would definitely try this method myself one day.

我认为 Eddy 是一个非常聪明且有创意的父亲。在他所有的建议中，我最喜欢的是他把打扫变成了寻宝游戏。这是一个非常巧妙的方法，让孩子们对做家务感到兴奋。他们不再觉得打扫无聊，而是把它当作游戏来看待。Eddy 的想法不仅让家里更整洁，还能让孩子在快乐中培养责任感。我将来一定也会尝试这种方法。

2. "a fun activities" → subject-verb agreement issue. "Activities" is plural, but "a" is singular. Corrected to "a fun activity".
