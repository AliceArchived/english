# Getting Older

Bea is at the gym with her friend, Eddy.

When she starts exercising, her knee makes a noise.

- Bea: What was that?!
- Eddy: What's wrong?
- Bea: My knee just **made** a **weird** noise!
- Eddy: That's because you're getting older.
- Bea: Eddy, **I'm not even thirty!**
- Eddy: Don't worry! I can show you some **exercise** to make your knees stronger.
- **Eddy shows Bea a leg exercise.**
- Bea: Great! But now my back hurts …
- Eddy: That's also because you're getting older.
- Bea: **Ugh**! Really?
- Eddy: Don't worry! I can show you an exercise to make your back stronger, too.
- **Eddy shows Bea another exercise for her back.**
- Bea: Thanks, Eddy!
- Eddy: No problem!
- Bea: Can you show me that leg exercise again?
- Eddy: You don't remember? I just showed it to you.
- Bea: I forgot … Is that because I'm getting older too?
- Eddy: Maybe, but I don't know any exercises for your brain.
