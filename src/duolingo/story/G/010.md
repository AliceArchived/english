# Grandmother's Recipe

Vikram walks into Eddy's apartment.

- **Eddy**: Hi Vikram, where's Priti?
- **Vikram**: She's **at work**, but she'll be here soon.
  - Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
- **Eddy**: You're **welcome**! You and Priti cook dinner for me often.
  - So now I'm going to cook for you!
- **Vikram**: You're cooking?! Uh… it smells … interesting!
- **Eddy**: Thanks! I'm making Priti's favorite meal.
- **Vikram**: Really? It's very difficult to make…

**Vikram looks at the food on the stove.**

- **Vikram**: Which kind of rice did you use?
- **Eddy**: There are different kinds of rice?

**Vikram tastes the food.**

- **Vikram**: Oh no. This tastes … a little strange.
- **Eddy**: Can you help me?
- **Vikram**: Maybe … I need four tomatoes, some onions, and a lot of **garlic**.
- **Eddy**: I don't have those things.
- **Vikram**: OK. Then we need your phone.

**Later, Eddy, Vikram and Priti are eating dinner.**

- **Priti**: Wow, Eddy, this is so good! It tastes just like my grandmother's **recipe**!
- **Eddy**: Thanks! I ordered it from the restaurant myself!
