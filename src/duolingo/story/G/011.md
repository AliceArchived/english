# Great Food, Bad Service - B2

Latest customer reviews for Vikram's bakery

- Priya - 3 days ago, 3/5 stars
  - Vikram's **exceptional** baked goods are always delicious, but to be honest, I don't recommend getting them delivered.
  - The delivery person, Lin, arrived an hour after the scheduled delivery time.
  - Plus, I only received nine muffins out of the twelve I ordered. She told me a goose attacked her and ate three **muffins**. The **crumbs** on her face suggested otherwise.
  - On the other hand, the owner, Vikram, was so attentive! After I told him what happened, he gave me a dozen free cookies!
  - Therefore, I'd recommend this bakery - as long as you're not in a rush.
- Julio - 2 weeks ago, 4/5 stars
  - It took me fifteen calls to get through to Vikram's bakery! The employee in charge of answering phones told me she only picks up when she "remembers there's a phone."
  - In contrast to this horrible experience, the cake Vikram made for my party was the best I've ever had.
  - I'd call another fifteen times in order to taste that cake again!
- Marguerite - 1 month ago, 5/5 stars
  - I love ordering from Vikram's bakery because you never know what you're going to get. Once, I ordered a **cinnamon roll**, but Lin delivered a dozen donuts instead.
  - Another time, I ordered a dozen donuts and received a wedding cake! I hope Lin messes up my order every time. I'd give Lin six stars if I could!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Based on these reviews, what do you think Vikram should do? Why?**

Based on these reviews, I think Vikram should really consider hiring a new employee to take Lin’s place. The reviews **suggest** that Lin **struggled** with **even simple tasks** — he was regularly late with deliveries, sometimes took customers’ food, and often delivered the wrong orders. These problems could seriously harm the business’s reputation, so it would be wise for Vikram to make a change.

根据这些评论，我觉得 Vikram 应该认真考虑雇用一位新员工来取代 Lin。评论中提到 Lin 连一些简单的任务都没做好——他经常送餐迟到，有时候会拿走顾客的食物，还经常送错餐。这些问题可能会严重影响店铺的声誉，所以 Vikram 做出改变是明智的选择。

### Practice History

**Based on these reviews, what do you think Vikram should do? Why?**

Based on these reviews, I think Vikram should find a new employee to replace Lin. Lin couldn't do basic things well — late delivery, **stealing customers' food**, and **delivering** wrong items.

> Corrections:

1. 原句中的 “late delivery, stealing customers' food, and delivering wrong items” 是名词短语 + 动名词混用，缺少完整句的结构，建议改成完整陈述句以提升连贯性。
2. “stealing customers’ food” 直接表述略显生硬，应加上 “according to the reviews” 或类似缓冲语，让说法更自然。
3. 用 “hire” 代替 “find” 会更自然，因为是在说雇用新员工。

Based on these reviews, I think Vikram should **hire** a new employee to replace Lin. **According to the reviews**, Lin couldn’t handle basic tasks properly — he was **often** late with **deliveries**, stole customers’ food, and delivered the wrong items.

根据这些评论，我认为 Vikram 应该雇一个新员工来取代 Lin。评论里提到 Lin 连基本的事情都做不好——他经常送餐迟到、偷顾客的食物，还送错东西。
