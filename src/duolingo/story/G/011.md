# Gray Hair

Kay and her husband, Jeff, are getting ready in the bathroom.

- **Kay**: Oh no!
- **Jeff**: What's wrong, my love?
- **Kay**: I found a gray hair **on** my head!
- **Jeff**: Your first gray hair! Let's have a party!
- **Kay**: That's not funny …
- **Jeff**: I'm sorry. But don't worry, it's only one gray hair.
- **Kay**: I have to **color my hair**!
- **Jeff**: Really?
- **Kay**: I'm not ready to have gray hair. I'm young!
- **Jeff**: Young people have gray hair too.
  - And **you'll look beautiful** when all of your hair is gray.
- **Kay**: All gray hair?!
- **Jeff**: Not now. When you're old —
- **Kay**: See? Gray hair is for old people!
- **Jeff**: Everyone **gets** old …
- **Kay**: You're right, but …
- **Jeff**: We'll be old together. I will always love you.
- **Kay**: I will always love you too. And you'll look great with a **bald head**!
- **Jeff**: What?
- **Kay**: Well, one day, you'll lose all of your hair.
  - Everyone gets old, Jeff …
- **Jeff**: Oh no…
