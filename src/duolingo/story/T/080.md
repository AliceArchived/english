# The Rooftop Party - B3

Lucy and Oscar arrive at a rooftop garden party filled with strange sculptures. Oscar adjusts his scarf dramatically.

- **Oscar**: Lucy, I'm so glad you invited me. This party is perfect for someone like me. I can express my genius to the right people.
- **Lucy**: Careful, Oscar. Don't scare the guests of honor with all your "genius."
- **Oscar**: Genius isn't scary, Lucy. It's inspiring! Look at these sculptures! They're… Hmm… interesting.
- **Lucy**: Don't criticize too much, Oscar. Perhaps the artists are here listening.
- **Oscar**: Let them listen! I'll teach them what good art is.

Oscar **leans closer** to a sculpture of colorful glass pieces **balanced on** a narrow metal pole.

- **Oscar**: This one is trying too hard. It's chaotic, with no clear idea —

Suddenly, Oscar **trips over** a rock and **crashes into** the sculpture. Glass **shatters** everywhere. Guests scream.

- **Lucy**: Oscar! What did you do? Watch out for the edges next time!
- **Oscar**: I — I was just… expressing myself! The sculpture… uh … wanted to fall!

The crowd murmurs. A tall artist in a black coat steps forward and claps loudly.

- **Lucy**: Oh no, here comes trouble.

The artist smiles widely.

This is perfect! You've created chaos! It's brilliant! You must collaborate with me on my next performance piece.

- **Lucy**: Well, Oscar, seems like you've become the star of the show.
- **Oscar**: Of course! Genius always shines brighter in the end.

**What happened when Oscar tripped over the rock?**

When Oscar tripped over a rock at the rooftop party, he lost his balance and fell into a colorful glass sculpture. The impact **caused** the sculpture to collapse and its glass pieces to **shatter across** the floor, **startling** the guests. Rather than apologizing, Oscar claimed he was just expressing himself and insisted that the sculpture “wanted to fall.” Surprisingly, one of the artists applauded his accidental chaos and invited him to collaborate on a new performance piece.

在天台派对上，Oscar 被一块石头绊倒，失去平衡撞上了一座五彩玻璃雕塑。撞击导致雕塑倒塌，玻璃碎片散落一地，吓到了在场的宾客。Oscar 并没有道歉，反而辩称自己只是在表达自我，还说雕塑“本来就想倒”。令人意外的是，一位艺术家为这场意外的混乱鼓掌，并邀请他参与下一场行为艺术的创作。

- startling: 英 /'stɑːtlɪŋ/, 美 /'stɑːrtlɪŋ/
  - adj. 令人震惊的,惊人的

### Practice History

**What happened when Oscar tripped over the rock?**

Oscar tripped / crashed into / shattering it

Oscar tripped over a rock and crashed into the sculpture, making glasses **shatter** onto the floor.

> Corrections:

1. The phrase “making glasses shatter” is grammatically correct, but “shattering the glasses” is more precise and concise in active voice.
2. The article “the” before “glasses” clarifies it was specific glasses from the sculpture.
3. The verb structure now more clearly follows the chain of events caused by Oscar’s fall.

Oscar tripped over a rock and crashed into the sculpture, **shattering** the glass pieces onto the floor.

Oscar 被一块石头绊倒，撞上了雕塑，把玻璃雕塑撞得粉碎，碎片散落在地板上。

Oscar tripped over a rock and hit a sculpture ~~made~~ it crashed into the floor. The ~~glasses~~ were shattering all over the floor and caused ~~a~~ chaos.

> Corrections:

1. "made it crashed" 应为 "making it crash"（使它摔落，用动名词短语更自然）。
2. "The glasses were shattering" 应为 "The glass shattered"。这里指玻璃碎了，而不是“眼镜”。**“Glass”作不可数名词更合适**。
3. "caused a chaos" 应为 "caused chaos"。英文中 “chaos” 是不可数名词，前面不加冠词 “a”。

Oscar tripped over a rock and hit a sculpture, **making** it crash to the floor. The glass **shattered** all over the floor and caused chaos.

Oscar 被一块石头绊倒，撞上了一个雕塑，使它摔到地上。玻璃碎了一地，引发了一片混乱。

> Corrections:

1. “hit a sculpture, making it crash” → 更自然的表达为 “crashed into a sculpture — knocking it to the floor”
2. “shattered all over the floor” → 更简洁地表达为 “shattered everywhere”

Oscar tripped over a rock and crashed into a sculpture — knocking it to the floor. The glass shattered everywhere and caused chaos.

Oscar 被一块石头绊倒，撞上了一座雕塑，把它撞到了地上。玻璃碎了一地，引发了一片混乱。
