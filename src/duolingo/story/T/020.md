# The Best Grade

Lily and Zari walk out of their history class.

Zari is holding a test. She's upset.

- **Zari**: I got one question wrong on this test!
- **Lily**: Only one wrong out of fifty? Congratulations.
- **Zari**: It's not good enough. Now I won't be able to go to college!
- **Lily**: But you got the best grade in the class. You don't have to be perfect.
- **Zari**: Yes, I do!
  - Maybe there's something more I can do.
- **Lily**: I don't understand why you want to do more work.
  - I always try to work less, not more.
- **Zari**: I really need a perfect grade!
- **Lily**: I guess you could talk to Ms. Schwartz, if it's that important.
- **Zari**: Great idea!

Zari goes to talk to Ms. Schwartz. Later, she finds Lily at lunch.

- **Zari**: I have great news!
- **Lily**: Can you take the test again?
- **Zari**: No. But I can improve my grade.
- **Lily**: How?
- **Zari**: I have to make a video about World War I **by Friday**.
- **Lily**: That's a lot of work. How are you going to do that all by yourself?
- **Zari**: I'm not!
  - You're going to help me.
- **Lily**: What?
- **Zari**: Sorryâ€¦ It was your idea.
