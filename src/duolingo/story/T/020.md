# The Audition

Lily is in the hall at school. Zari runs over to her.

- **Zari**: Lily! I'm going to an audition for a play after school. Can you please come with me?
- **Lily**: No.
- **Zari**: Please? I'm too nervous to do it by myself.
- **Lily**: You'll be fine.
- **Zari**: No, I won't. If I get too nervous, I might **faint**.
- **Lily**: That only happens on TV.
- **Zari**: No. It happens **at** theater auditions.
  - Please come with me, Lily. I need you.
- **Lily**: Ugh... OK.
- **Zari**: Thank you!

They go to the audition at the local theater. Their art teacher, Oscar, is sitting at a table.

- **Lily**: Oh, Mr. Oscar is directing the play?
- **Zari**: That's why I was so nervous.
- **Oscar**: OK, actors, are you ready to begin your audition?
- **Lily**: Wait, I have to perform with you?
- **Zari**: Of course! That's why I **needed** you to come. Don't worry, we can do this!

Lily suddenly looks very worried.

- **Zari**: Lily? Are you OK?
- **Lily**: I don't feel well. I ... think I'm going to ...

Lily faints.

- **Zari**: Lily!

Later, Lily wakes up.

- **Zari**: I told you people faint at auditions.
- **Lily**: Ugh, Zari...
- **Zari**: Thanks for going to the audition with me. And I have good news...
  - I'm going to be in the play! After you fainted, I wasn't nervous anymore! My audition was great!
  - And you're going to be in the play too!
- **Lily**: What? But I fainted.
- **Zari**: I know! Because you were so good at lying on the floor, they chose you to be a dead body in the play!
- **Lily**: Oh...
  - That's actually pretty cool.

## Writing

### Lily was afraid to speak in public. Do you like speaking in public? Why?

No, I like not to speak in public. But if I really need to speak in public, I won't faint, but I need to prepare. For me, if there is enough practice, it will be fine.

> Corrections:

1. “I like not to speak in public”
   - → unnatural; better as “I prefer not to speak in public.”
2. “I won’t faint, but I need to prepare”
   - → okay, but could be smoother.
3. “For me, if there is enough practice, it will be fine”
   - → slightly awkward phrasing.

No, I **prefer not to** speak in public. But if I really have to, I won’t faint **—** I just need to prepare. **As long as** I get enough practice, I’ll be fine.
