# The Best Cookies

Junior and Eddy are in Vikram's kitchen.

- **Eddy**: It's so great that you're letting us try new cookie recipes for your bakery.
- **Junior**: And when your bakery opens, we'll have free cookies for the rest of our lives!
- **Vikram**: Let me get my notebook, and then you can try the cookies.

Vikram leaves. Eddy and Junior look at a plate of cookies on the table.

- **Eddy**: They look so good. Maybe we should try one now.
- **Junior**: Vikram told us to wait!
- **Eddy**: But they're probably still warm...
- **Junior**: I guess we could try a very small bite…

Junior grabs one of the cookies, takes a bite, and immediately spits it out.

- **Junior**: Yuck! This cookie is terrible!
- **Eddy**: Vikram is an amazing baker. You probably picked a bad cookie.

Eddy takes a bite of a cookie.

- **Eddy**: Hmm. It's kind of dry and hard.

Eddy tastes another cookie.

- **Eddy**: They definitely have a unique flavor.
- **Junior**: Did he forget to add the sugar?
- **Eddy**: Junior, we have to tell Vikram that we like these cookies.
- **Junior**: I thought you said we should always be honest!
- **Eddy**: If we tell him how weird these cookies are, he'll feel really bad.

Vikram comes back into the kitchen.

- **Vikram**: Are you ready to try my cookies?
- **Eddy**: We already tried them! They're sooo good!
- **Junior**: And now we have to go!
- **Vikram**: But… the cookies are still in the oven.

Vikram goes to the oven and takes out a pan of cookies.

- **Eddy**: We ate the cookies that were on the table!
- **Vikram**: That ones shaped like bones? Those are **dog treats**.
- **Junior**: We ate dog food?!
- **Eddy**: Oh, these are pretty good for dog treats! I'm impressed!
- **Junior**: I think I'm going to be sick.

> Corrections:

1. The word "of" is fine here, but the sentence flow could be smoother.
2. "That radish" at the end is slightly awkward in tone — more natural to say "I really grew to like it" or "I ended up enjoying it".

> Corrections:

1. **“is some pickled vegetables”**
   - → 不定冠词错误，应为 **“a type of pickled vegetable”**（“vegetables” 是复数，但“some”不适合这种特指经历表达）
2. **“I just can't eat it”**
   - → 时态错误，应为过去式 **“I couldn’t eat it”**
3. **“so weird — spicy with some unknown ingredients”**
   - → 更自然为 **“tasted so strange: spicy, with some unknown ingredients.”**（加入“tasted”说明是味觉体验）
4. **“after years”**
   - → 应为 **“after a few years”** 或 **“over time”**，表达逐渐接受更自然
5. **“I really love this snack”**
   - → 更地道表达是 **“I grew to love this snack”**

### Examples

**The Strangest Food I Have Ever Tasted**

It was extremely salty, **fiery** with chili, and had a **pungent** smell that I found **overwhelming**. At the time, I simply could not understand why people enjoyed it, and I avoided eating it whenever possible.

However, after living in Sichuan for four years, my **perspective** gradually changed. Surrounded by local **cuisine** and **culture**, I began to develop a deeper appreciation for **bold flavors**. Over time, I gave the radish another try, and to my surprise, I started to enjoy its **crunchiness** and **the complex layers of taste**. Eventually, it became one of my favorite side dishes.

This experience taught me that our tastes are not fixed — they can evolve through **exposure**, **experience**, and **open-mindedness**. What once seemed strange can become something familiar and even beloved.

这段经历让我明白，人的口味是会随着经历和接纳度而变化的，曾经觉得奇怪的东西，也许最终会变成一种喜爱。
