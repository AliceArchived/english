# The Magic School

Eddy is in the kitchen reading his son Junior's book.

- **Junior**: Is that my book about the boy who goes to the magic school?
- **Eddy**: Yes! This book is so good! I can't wait to see how it ends.
- **Junior**: Well, Peter fights the evil snake king...
- **Eddy**: Stop! Don't tell me!
- **Junior**: Hmmm...

Junior opens the freezer.

- **Junior**: If I can have ice cream before dinner, then I won't tell you how the book ends.
- **Eddy**: What? No!
- **Junior**: OK. The book ends when Peter runs into the dark forest...
- **Eddy**: Wait! You can have ice cream before dinner. But only tonight!
- **Junior**: Yay! I'm going to eat it while I watch that new movie, 101 Murders.
- **Eddy**: No, that movie is too scary for you!
- **Junior**: If you don't let me watch it then I'll tell you how the book ends...
- **Eddy**: Junior...
- **Junior**: ...so Peter and his friends find the snake king's palace...
- **Eddy**: OK! You can watch the movie.
  - Just don't tell me the ending of this book.

Later that week, Eddy is in the kitchen making dinner.

Junior goes to the freezer to get some ice cream.

- **Eddy**: Sorry, Junior.
  - You can't have ice cream tonight.
- **Junior**: OK... so then I have to tell you how the book ends...
- **Eddy**: You're too late! I already finished the book, so I know what happens!
- **Junior**: Oh no.
- **Eddy**: And I read the rest of the books in the series!
- **Junior**: What?!
- **Eddy**: Now you have to clean your room, or I'll tell you what happens in the next three books!
