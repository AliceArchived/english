# The Drawing

Lily is sitting in Mr. Hanson's classroom. Her textbook is open on her desk.

- **Hanson**: Lily! You can't draw **in** your textbook!
- **Lily**: What? I don't draw in **textbooks**.

He points to a funny drawing of a man in her textbook. It says “Mr. Hanson” next to it.

- **Hanson**: Is this a drawing of me with a huge nose?
- **Lily**: Yes, but I didn't draw it.
- **Hanson**: I don't believe you.
- **Lily**: I'm a much better artist than the person who **drew** that picture. Watch.

Lily goes to the front of the classroom and begins drawing a large picture of Mr. Hanson on the blackboard.

- **Lily**: Yes, your nose is huge, but your ears are huge too.
  - **That's what's wrong with the other drawing**. Your ears weren't big enough.

Lily continues drawing.

- **Lily**: And your beard isn't long enough in the drawing.

Some of the other students start laughing.

- **Hanson**: I don't look like that!
- **Lily**: Yes, you do. This is a much better drawing **of** you.
- **Hanson**: OK, maybe you didn't draw **the other picture**. But now you have to go to the **principal's** office.
