# The Dragon Cake

Bea is watching Vikram decorate a wedding cake for her friend, Kara.

- **Bea**: Wow, I love how you decorated the cake!
  The **bride** and **groom** are **riding** dragons, just like the characters from Kara and David's favorite TV show!

- **Vikram**: Kara's my first customer. I just hope that she'll like the cake.

Bea gets a text message from Kara.

- **Bea**: Oh no! Kara canceled the wedding!

- **Vikram**: What? Why?!

- **Bea**: David stole her car and left the country with another woman!

- **Vikram**: That's awful!

- **Bea**: I can't believe it.

- **Vikram**: I know. I really wanted Kara to like this cake.

- **Bea**: I have an idea.

Bea redecorates the cake.

- **Vikram**: Wait, now it looks like the dragons are eating the groom!

Bea takes a picture and sends it to Kara. Then, she smiles.

- **Bea**: Kara just sent me **a** message!
- **Vikram**: What did she say?
- **Bea**: She's still really sad, but she loves the cake.
- **Vikram**: That's all I wanted!
