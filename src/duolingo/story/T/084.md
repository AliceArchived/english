# The Shipwreck Exhibit - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

There's a new exhibit at the history museum featuring shipwrecks. It's full of **artifacts**, ropes, and details of how people survived these dangerous situations. Everyone is excited to see it, and it seems like a big hit around town.

I hate it. I went with Zari because she thought it would be cool. But when I got there, it was just a bunch of old, broken things. I could smell the dust and the aged wood. It's like they collected shipwrecks just to ruin my day.

The exhibit is supposed to show how people survived these disasters. They even have a video that investigates what happened to the ships. But it's just a reminder of all the things that can go wrong when leaving the house. I prefer not to think about such things. My idea of fun doesn't include imagining myself in a sinking ship and fighting off crabs on a deserted island.

Meanwhile, everyone else seemed so **engaged**. Kids **pressed their faces up against the glass**, asking questions and investigating every artifact. It's like they all turned into little detectives. But in my opinion, they should have been wondering why they weren't just at home watching TV or, better yet, reading a good book.

The museum should reconsider these kinds of exhibits. In that case, I wouldn't have to listen to people excitedly talk about exploring shipwrecks. Let's keep in mind that surviving a shipwreck is something I'd rather not think through. I'll stick to reading about such things in my room, far from ropes and rusty ship parts.

## Vocabulary

- artifacts: 英 /'a:rtifækts/, 美 /'a:rtifækts/
  - n. 史前古器物

## Style

- It's like they collected shipwrecks just to ruin my day.
  - Correction: “It's **as if** they collected shipwrecks just to ruin my day.”
  - “As if” is more appropriate in formal writing for hypothetical or sarcastic comparisons.
- "think through" in "something I'd rather not think through."
  - Correction: "something I'd rather not think about."
  - “Think about” is the standard collocation here. “Think through” implies planning or solving, which isn’t the intended meaning.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**What part of the exhibit would you enjoy most?**

I think the exhibit is really engaging. For me, the most fascinating part would be learning about the ship’s history — especially how it sank and how people responded during the disaster. I find those real-life survival stories incredibly moving. Also, I think it’s great that the exhibit includes interactive parts for kids, like tracking specific details. That kind of hands-on activity makes learning more memorable and enjoyable, not just for children, but for adults as well.

我觉得这个展览非常引人入胜。对我来说，最吸引人的部分是了解这艘船的历史，特别是它是如何沉没的，以及人们在灾难中是如何应对的。我觉得这种真实的求生故事特别感人。另外，我认为展览中还有互动部分也很棒，比如让孩子们追踪细节。这种动手参与的方式不仅让孩子们学得更深刻，也让大人觉得更有趣。

### Practice History

**What part of the exhibit would you enjoy most?**

Helpful Phrases: I think/ For me, / The best part

I think the exhibit is fun. For me, I **am** interested in the history of how it **sank** and how people **fought** in that situation. And also the best part is it gives kids an opportunity to track details.

> Corrections:

1. “I am interested” is grammatically correct, but it’s more natural in spoken English to use “I’m interested in” as a contraction.
2. The sentence “And also the best part is…” is slightly awkward. It’s better to drop “And” at the start of the sentence and say “Also, the best part is that…”

think the exhibit is fun. For me, **I’m** interested in the history of how it **sank** and how people **fought** in that situation. **Also**, the best part is **that** it gives kids an opportunity to track details.

我觉得这个展览很有趣。对我来说，我对它是如何沉没的历史，以及人们在那种情况下如何应对感兴趣。而且最棒的部分是，它给孩子们提供了追踪细节的机会。
