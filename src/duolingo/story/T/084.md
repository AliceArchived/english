# The Vacuum Debate - B3

Eddy and Junior are in the living room. Eddy points to the vacuum cleaner.

- **Eddy**: Junior, time to vacuum the floor. It's a mess in here.
- **Junior**: I can't. The noise will ruin my video game **vibes**.
- **Eddy**: Your 'vibes'? What does that even mean?
- **Junior**: Dad, in my game, the hero needs focus. If I vacuum, we'll lose the battle!

Eddy looks at Junior, confused but amused.

- **Eddy**: So, your game hero depends on a **quiet** house?
- **Junior**: Exactly. No noise, no stress! **Quiet** means victory!

Eddy scratches his head.

- **Eddy**: Fine, no vacuuming… for now.

Eddy heads to the kitchen. Junior keeps playing his game.

A little while later, Eddy comes back with a big bag.

- **Junior**: What's in the bag?
- **Eddy**: Popcorn! It's movie night.
- **Junior**: Yes! Can I have some?

Eddy shakes his head.

- **Eddy**: Nope. I can't share. Crumbs will ruin the movie night vibes.
- **Junior**: What?! That's not the same thing!
- **Eddy**: Oh, I think it is. **Quiet** vibes. Movie vibes. Same rule.

Junior puts down his controller.

- **Junior**: Fine, I'll vacuum. But this 'vibes' thing? Terrible rule, Dad.
- **Eddy**: **Says the kid who invented it!**
