# The Interview

Bea is at the office of a non-profit company for an interview. She sits down next to a man.

- **Bea**: Wow, I'm really nervous.
- **Man**: Oh, why?
- **Bea**: I really hope I get this job. I care about the environment a lot.
- **Man**: Oh, don't be nervous!
  - You're not going to get the job.
- **Bea**: Excuse me?
- **Man**: Clearly, I'm the best person for the job.
  - You're drinking your coffee with a **straw**. Plastic **straws** kill **turtles**.
- **Bea**: Actually, this straw is made of recycled paper.
  - And look, you're using a plastic coffee cup. Plastic is really bad for our oceans.
- **Man**: Uh … I usually use a glass bottle, but I forgot to bring it.
  - I drove here in an electric car, though!
- **Bea**: Well, I rode my bicycle here! And I only buy clothes made of recycled materials!
- **Man**: Oh, that's why your clothes look terrible!
- **Bea**: You're the rudest person I've ever met!
- **Woman**: Excuse me!

Bea realized that the interviewer is standing behind them.

- **Woman**: You're arguing **really loudly**.
- **Bea**: I'm so sorry.
- **Woman**: But … I can see that you both really care about the environment.
  - I want you both to work for me!
- **Man**: Yes! I got the job!
- **Bea**: Will I have to work with him every day?
- **Woman**: Of course! You'll be a team.
- **Bea**: No, thanks. I don't want this job that much.
