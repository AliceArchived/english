# The Bookshelf Challenge - B3

Oscar and Eddy are in the school theater. A **prop bookshelf** lies in pieces on the floor.

- **Eddy**: OK, Oscar! Let's build this bookshelf. It's going to be easy.
- **Oscar**: Easy? Eddy, this takes skill. You don't have any clue how to build it.
- **Eddy**: What? I could build this with my eyes closed!
- **Oscar**: Hmm… I don't think so.
- **Eddy**: Fine. Let's make it a challenge. Who can put it together best?
- **Oscar**: The best? Please, Eddy. I'll make it perfect. I have an artistic eye, after all.

They start building. Eddy picks up a wooden frame and fits it upside down.

- **Oscar**: That's such a childish mistake!
- **Eddy**: Childish? I'm doing great! Look at you — you forgot to put that piece in!
- **Oscar**: I didn't forget. I'm planning! Good art takes time.

They argue while building. Pieces start falling off their work.

- **Eddy**: This is your fault, Oscar! You're too slow.
- **Oscar**: Slow? You're rushing everything! That's why it looks so bad!

The bookshelf is half-done, **wobbling** dangerously.

- **Eddy**: It's fine! Just one more piece!
- **Oscar**: One more? No, it needs more support —

The bookshelf collapses loudly.

- **Eddy**: Uh… I think we lost the challenge.
- **Oscar**: No, Eddy. You lost the challenge.
- **Eddy**: Oh, come on! At least I tried!
- **Oscar**: Tried? You tried too hard!

The theater director walks in and gasps.

- **Oscar**: Well, I guess this was… modern art?
- **Eddy**: Yeah! Art! Let's call it that!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why did the bookshelf collapse?**

The bookshelf collapsed because Eddy and Oscar were **too busy** arguing with each other **instead of** focusing on building it properly.

书架会倒塌，是因为 Eddy 和 Oscar 一直在互相争吵，而没有专心把它好好搭建起来。

### Practice History

**Why did the bookshelf collapse?**

The bookshelf/ because/ built it

The bookshelf collapsed because Eddy and Oscar were more focused on arguing, not on how to build it.

> Corrections:

1. “not on how to build it” → 改为 **“than** on how to build it” 更符合英语中“rather than”结构的对比语法

The bookshelf collapsed because Eddy and Oscar were **more** focused on arguing **than** on how to build it.

书架之所以倒塌，是因为 Eddy 和 Oscar 更专注于争吵，而不是怎么去搭建它。
