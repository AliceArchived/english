# The Bakery

Josh and Jane are giving Vikram a tour of their bakery.

- **Josh**: A lot of people are interested in our bakery. We're selling it **at a great price** …
- **Jane**: Yes … because we're getting **a** divorce.
- **Vikram**: Oh no … I'm sorry.
- **Josh**: Jane! Don't tell everyone that.
- **Jane**: Well, Josh, it's true.
- **Vikram**: Uh … well, I'm the best person to buy your bakery. I'll take great care of it.
  - Wow, this is an amazing oven!
- **Josh**: Yes, we baked a lot of great cookies in that oven.
- **Vikram**: I've had your cookies. They're fantastic!
  - Did you use this **mixer** to make them?
- **Josh**: Yes. I also used it to make Jane's favorite pie.
- **Jane**: It was my grandmother's recipe …
- **Vikram**: You two really were a great team.
- **Josh**: Yeah, we were.
- **Jane**: I think so too…
- **Josh**: Jane … Can I talk to you alone?

Jane and Josh leave. A few minutes later, they come back.

- **Jane**: Vikram, Josh and I have made a decision …
- **Vikram**: You're not getting divorced?
- **Jane**: Oh, we're still getting divorced.
- **Josh**: We had a terrible marriage.
- **Jane**: But we have a great bakery!
- **Vikram**: So you're not selling it anymore?
- **Jane**: No. But you can always come back for some cookies!
