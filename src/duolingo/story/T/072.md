# The Reading Club - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

Our school has a new reading club. It's getting started this week.

Everyone seems excited to join. The club will read different books and talk about them. The next steps include picking a book and meeting every Friday.

I hate it. The idea of a reading club is not **thrilling**. As far as I'm concerned, I do not need to talk to people about books. I read alone in my room, surrounded by silence. That's my idea of a good time.

In the reading club, I'll have to make eye contact and smile. I'll need to pay attention to other people's opinions. I have my own opinions about books, and I don't need to share them. There might be discussions about characters and themes. I get the feeling we'll spend lots of time talking, and less time reading.

Zari told me she's excited to join. She's likely to ask me to come along. I suppose I'll have to listen to her talk about all the books she's read. She'll probably make me talk too. But I have no clue how to say no when she insists.

So, let's cancel this reading club idea before it gets started. Even if I had to attend, I wouldn't enjoy turning books into group activities. Reading deserves to be a solo journey. I hope everyone figures out that reading alone is the best way to enjoy a book.

阅读俱乐部

Lily 的校报专栏

我们学校成立了一个新的阅读俱乐部。本周开始运作。

大家似乎都很兴奋地想加入。俱乐部会阅读不同的书，并讨论它们。接下来的步骤包括选一本书，并在每周五见面。

我讨厌这个主意。阅读俱乐部的想法一点也不让人激动。就我而言，我不需要和别人讨论书。我喜欢一个人在房间里阅读，被安静包围。这才是我理想的美好时光。

在阅读俱乐部里，我得与人眼神交流，还得微笑。我必须注意听别人的意见。我对书有自己的看法，但我不需要分享它们。可能会有关于人物和主题的讨论。我觉得我们会花很多时间说话，而读书的时间会更少。

Zari 跟我说她很期待加入。她很可能会邀请我一起去。我想我得听她滔滔不绝地讲她读过的所有书。她大概还会逼我也说几句。但她一旦坚持，我根本不知道该怎么拒绝。

所以，在这个阅读俱乐部开始之前，我们就该取消它。即便我必须参加，我也不会喜欢把读书变成集体活动。阅读应该是一段独自的旅程。我希望大家都能明白，独自阅读才是享受一本书的最佳方式。

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?**

I don’t think we should cancel the reading club just because Lily feels stressed. I completely understand her situation, but in my view, it’s important to remember that the club is **voluntary**. People can decide whether they want to join based on their **comfort level**. If someone enjoys reading in a group, they’re welcome to participate, but if they find it **overwhelming**, they’re free to leave. This way, the club can still benefit those who genuinely enjoy it without forcing anyone to stay.

我不认为应该因为 Lily 感到压力就取消读书会。我完全理解她的处境，但在我看来，必须记住这个活动是自愿的。人们可以根据自己的舒适程度决定是否加入。如果有人喜欢在小组中读书，他们可以参加；如果觉得有压力，也可以选择退出。这样，读书会既能为真正喜欢它的人提供价值，也不会强迫任何人留下。

> Explanation:

1. Balanced tone: Shows empathy for Lily but also considers the group’s benefit.
2. Clear structure: States opinion → acknowledges Lily → explains choice → provides conclusion.
3. Lexical range: Uses “voluntary,” “comfort level,” “overwhelming,” “genuinely enjoy.”
4. Spoken fluency: Natural linking phrases and conversational flow.

- voluntary: 英 /'vɒləntri/, 美 /'vɑːlənteri/
  - adj. 自愿的, 志愿的
    - 义务的, 无偿的

### 🌟 Writing Band 7.0+

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?**

I believe the reading club should not be cancelled solely because one member feels stressed. While I **sympathize** with Lily and understand that group activities can sometimes be overwhelming, the club provides value to many other participants who genuinely enjoy reading and discussing books together. Participation should remain **voluntary**, allowing individuals to join or leave based on their personal preferences. This **flexible approach** ensures that the club remains inclusive without forcing anyone to engage in an activity that makes them uncomfortable. Ultimately, the aim of such a club is to **foster** a love of reading, not to create pressure.

我认为不应仅仅因为某位成员感到压力就取消读书会。虽然我对 Lily 表示同情，也理解集体活动有时会让人感到负担，但读书会为许多真正喜欢读书并乐于讨论的人带来了价值。参加应保持自愿原则，让人们根据个人喜好选择加入或退出。这种灵活的方式可以确保读书会保持包容性，同时不会强迫任何人参与让他们不舒服的活动。归根结底，这类活动的目的在于培养阅读的热爱，而不是制造压力。

> Explanation:

1. Task achievement: Fully addresses the question with balanced reasoning.
2. Coherence: Smooth logical flow from empathy → group value → voluntary nature → conclusion.
3. Lexical sophistication: Uses academic expressions like “solely because,” “participants,” “inclusive,” “foster a love of reading.”
4. Grammatical accuracy: Contains varied sentence structures and no errors.

- inclusive: 英 /ɪn'kluːsɪv/, 美 /ɪn'kluːsɪv/
  - adj. 包括…的, 包括一切的
    - 包括所述的限度

### Practice History

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the reading club?**

Helpful Phrases: I think/ Lily feels/ In my opinion

I don't think we should **cancel** the reading club. Lily feels stressed in the club and I **totally** understand her. However, in my opinion, **the** reading club is an option for everybody; **people** can choose to join the club if they feel comfortable, **and** if not they can quit.

> Corrections:

1. Added a comma after “club” in the second sentence for correct punctuation.
2. “is an option” → “**should be an option**” sounds more natural and conveys a recommendation rather than just a fact.
3. Minor adjustments to improve flow and formality without changing meaning.

I don't think we should cancel the reading club. Lily feels stressed in the club, and I totally understand her. However, in my opinion, the reading club **should be an option** for everybody; people can choose to join if they feel comfortable, and if not, they can quit.

我认为我们不应该取消读书会。Lily 在读书会里感到有压力，我完全理解她。不过，在我看来，读书会应该是对所有人开放的选择；如果觉得适合，可以参加，如果不适合，也可以退出。
