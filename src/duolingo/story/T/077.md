# The Right Time

Lin and Bea are in a clothing store.

- **Bea**: Let's get pizza now.
- **Lin**: I can't. I'm going to dinner with Jennifer.
- **Bea**: I thought you broke up with Jennifer after New Year's Eve.
- **Lin**: I was going to break up with her then, but her birthday was two weeks later.
- **Bea**: Yes, but now it's April!
- **Lin**: I know, but we planned a lot of trips for the spring!

Lin and Bea **stand in line at** the fitting room.

- **Bea**: You should just **break up with** her now!
- **Lin**: I'm just waiting for the right time.
  - Her mother is visiting this weekend.
- **Bea**: What about next week?
- **Lin**: Next week we're visiting her cousin in Hawaii! I don't want to make her sad during her vacation.
- **Bea**: So when are you going to break up with Jennifer?!
- **Lin**: I told you that I'm waiting for the right time!

The fitting room door suddenly opens. Jennifer comes out.

- **Lin**: Jennifer!
- **Jennifer**: I think this is the right time.
- **Lin**: But what about Hawaii?
