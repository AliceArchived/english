# The Principal's Office

Eddy is sitting **across** from Principal Williams at his son Junior's school.

- **Williams**: Usually, Junior is a perfect student. He's smart, kind, and polite. But recently, he has been misbehaving.
- **Eddy**: Oh no, what did he do now?
- **Williams**: He released a **pigeon** in the cafeteria.
- **Eddy**: Where did he get a pigeon?
- **Williams**: And last week, he **took apart** the science teacher's chair.
- **Eddy**: Wow! I didn't know he could do that.
- **Williams**: And the week before that, he filled my office with **balloons**.
- **Eddy**: That probably took hours!
- **Williams**: Is everything OK at home?
- **Eddy**: I **thought** so, until now.
- **Williams**: Why don't we talk to him together?

Junior enters the office and sits down.

- **Williams**: Junior, we are both very worried about you.
- **Junior**: That's one thing you have in common!
  - Also, you both like Italian food and soccer.
  - Sorry that you're missing the big soccer game on TV right now, Dad.
- **Eddy**: I really wanted to watch that game.
- **Williams**: I did too.
- **Junior**: Do you guys want to talk about soccer alone? Should I leave?
- **Williams**: Junior, we need to talk about your behaviour at school.
- **Junior**: You can do that without me. And then you can talk about everything else that you have in common, like being single.
- **Eddy**: Why does it matter that we're both single?
- **Williams**: I think I know what's going on.
  - Junior, are you getting in trouble on purpose because you want me to date your father?
- **Junior**: Of course! You both love to punish me, so you should be together!

2. “so the **principle** would meet his father” 中 “principle” 拼错，应为 “**principal**”（校长）。
3. “Junior wants them to be together.” 时态应保持一致，建议改为过去时 “**wanted**” 和加上主语更清楚。
