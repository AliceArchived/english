# The Practice Date - B2

Bea is **comforting** her friend, Eddy, at his apartment while Eddy lies face down on the floor.

- **Bea**: You poor thing! I'm sorry your date never texted back.
- **Eddy**: And I did exactly what you said!
  - I'll be single forever!
- **Bea**: Don't worry, I have an idea! Let's have a practice date.
  - I'll teach you everything you need to know about dating.
- **Eddy**: Really? OK, let's go now!

Bea **frowns** at Eddy's **tracksuit**.

- **Bea**: Where's your suit?
- **Eddy**: I'd rather wear comfortable clothes.
- **Bea**: Do you want my help or not?

Later, Eddy and Bea are at a restaurant, and Eddy is wearing **a dress shirt**. He tries to loosen his tie.

- **Bea**: What do you talk about on dates?
- **Eddy**: Usually, I tell jokes. I've **memorized a bunch** of jokes from a book!
- **Bea**: Eddy, if you want to be charming, you can't repeat things from a book.
- **Eddy**: You're right, I should quote movies instead.
- **Bea**: No! Let's discuss something **intellectual**, like world affairs.
- **Eddy**: I'd rather talk about movies. I don't know anything about world affairs.
- **Bea**: You have to learn! Tell me what you think about the economy.
- **Eddy**: It's ... bad?
- **Bea**: OK ... that was hard. Here's an easy one. How do you feel about the latest unemployment rates?
- **Eddy**: This is too complicated! How can I find my soulmate when I'm in uncomfortable clothes talking about things I don't understand?

Eddy lays his head down on the table. Bea thinks for a moment.

- **Bea**: I'm sorry, Eddy. This must have been a really frustrating night. I was wrong. It's always more important to be yourself.
- **Eddy**: Yes. In this life, it's so hard to find a connection. We're all just floating through space, hoping to feel a little less alone. Beep beep boop.
- **Bea**: That's beautiful! The end was a little weird, though ... Did you just come up with that?
- **Eddy**: No, it's from my favorite movie, "Space Robots in Love"!

### Why **"a dress shirt"** instead of just **"a shirt"?**

Because **“a dress shirt”** is **more specific**. It refers to a **formal, button-up shirt**, usually worn for special occasions like dining out, interviews, or events.

**Difference:**

| Term            | Meaning                                                                      | Example                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **shirt**       | General term for any shirt (T-shirt, polo, casual shirt, etc.)               | He wore a shirt and jeans.                     |
| **dress shirt** | A formal shirt with a collar and buttons, often worn with trousers or a suit | He wore a dress shirt to the fancy restaurant. |

- **shirt** = 衬衫（泛指任何衬衫）
- **dress shirt** = 正装衬衫 / 正式衬衫（有领、有扣子，用于正式场合）

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Do you agree with Bea's advice? Why or why not?**

Personally, I don’t agree with Bea’s advice. If Eddy truly wants to find a soulmate, he should **be genuine** and **show his real personality**. Pretending to be someone he’s not might attract the wrong kind of person, and in the long run, that won’t lead to **a meaningful or lasting relationship**. Being **authentic** is always the best way to **build a true connection**.

我个人并不同意 Bea 的建议。如果 Eddy 真的想找到灵魂伴侣，他就应该真实地展现自己。假装成另一个人可能会吸引到不合适的人，从长远来看，这样的关系既不真诚，也难以长久。做真实的自己，才是建立真正联系的最佳方式。

- genuine: 英 /ˈdʒenjuɪn/, 美 /ˈdʒenjuɪn/
  - adj. 真实的，真正的；诚恳的
- authentic: 英 /ɔːˈθentɪk/, 美 /ɔːˈθentɪk/
  - adj. 真的, 真正的
  - 可靠的, 可信的

I disagree with Bea’s advice **because I believe** finding a partner is about being with someone who **shares** your lifestyle and **makes** you **feel at ease**. Eddy clearly doesn’t feel comfortable **dressing** formally or **having** deep political conversations. He would be **better off** with someone who enjoys things like exercising and watching movies — activities that **genuinely** match his personality.

我不同意 Bea 的建议，因为我认为找伴侣应该是找一个和你生活方式相近、让你感到轻松的人。很明显，Eddy 并不喜欢穿正式的衣服或进行严肃的政治讨论。他更适合找一个喜欢锻炼和看电影的人，这些活动更符合他的性格。

### Practice History

**Do you agree with Bea's advice? Why or why not?**

> Corrections:

1. "act as what he is" is awkward and unnatural in English.
   - Better: “be himself” or “act like himself.”
2. “not **fake** to someone else”
   - → “fake” is a verb here, and this phrasing is incorrect.
   - It should be “not **pretend to be someone else**” or “not **be fake**.”

I don't agree with Bea's advice. If Eddy wants to find a **soulmate**, he needs to **be himself**, not **pretend** to be someone else.

I don't agree with Bea's advice. Finding a partner **means finding someone with whom** you are comfortable when **you** are together. As for Eddy, he doesn't feel comfortable when **wearing** suits or **discussing** global issues. For him, it's better to find a girl who loves exercising and watching **movies**.

> Corrections:

1. "with whom you are comfortable when you are together" → grammatically correct but a bit repetitive. Can be smoothed.
2. "better to find a girl who loves exciting and watching movies" → grammar issue; needs restructuring for clarity.

I don’t agree with Bea’s advice. Finding a partner means **choosing** someone **you feel** truly **comfortable around**. **In** Eddy’s **case**, he doesn’t enjoy **wearing suits** or **talking about** global issues. **He would be much happier** with someone who enjoys exercising and watching movies — **just like he does**.
