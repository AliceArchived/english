# The Warranty - B2

Bea is creating an important presentation for work. Her friend Lin is lying on the sofa, playing a mobile game.

- **Bea**: Ugh! The only thing more annoying than my job is my computer. It keeps **freezing**.
- **Lin**: I'll fix it!

Lin throws Bea's computer on the ground.

- **Bea**: Why did you do that?!
- **Lin**: So you can get a new computer. You have a **warranty**, right?
  - Just bring it into the store. They won't be able to fix it, so they'll just give you a new computer.
- **Bea**: That's not how you're supposed to use a warranty!
- **Lin**: Don't worry, I've done this tons of times.

Lin puts Bea's laptop in the sink and turns on the **faucet**.

- **Lin**: Water damage always makes it worse!
- **Bea**: Lin! You break your laptop on purpose just to get a new one?! You shouldn't do that!
- **Lin**: Just trust me.

Lin and Bea bring Bea's computer to the repair technician at the store.

- **Lin**: Hi, my friend needs a new computer. It should be **covered** by her warranty.
- **Man**: Wow, this laptop is in terrible condition! What happened?
- **Lin**: It fell into a bathtub.
- **Man**: Why was the laptop in the bathroom?
- **Lin**: It wasn't. It was on the kitchen table.
- **Man**: What?
- **Lin**: My friend has a very small apartment.

Suddenly, the store manager rushes over and points at Lin.

- **Manager**: You! I banned you from this store!
  - You kept breaking your laptop and using your warranty to get a new one.
- **Bea**: But this isn't her laptop. It's mine!

The manager turns to Bea.

- **Manager**: You're friends with this **scam artist**?
- **Lin**: Actually, she's my best friend.
- **Manager**: Then you're both banned from this store!

A security guard **escorts** Lin and Bea out of the store.

- **Bea**: Lin! How am I going to finish my presentation now? It's due tomorrow.
- **Lin**: Well, now that your laptop is broken, I guess you can't finish your presentation. You're welcome!

## Writing

### How do you think Bea is feeling about Lin right now? Explain your answer.

I think that Bea ~~would~~ be upset with Lin. She always **makes** things worse ~~while~~ she feels good with herself.

> Corrections:

1. "Bea would be upset" implies hypothetical or future
   - better to use present continuous or simple present if referring to a current situation.
2. "makes things worse while she feels good with herself" is unclear and awkward in structure.
   - “While she feels good with herself” should be rephrased for clarity.

I think Bea is upset with Lin. Lin always makes things worse, even though she feels good about herself.
我认为 Bea 现在对 Lin 很生气。Lin 总是把事情搞得更糟，虽然她自己感觉很好。

---

I think that Bea **is** probably very angry at Lin. Lin doesn't solve the problem, but **makes** the problem worse.
