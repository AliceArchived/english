# The Weekend Manager - B2

Lucy stops her granddaughter, Lin, as she leaves for her part-time job at Vikram's bakery.

- **Lucy**: Lin, Vikram is hiring a weekend manager.
  - With that promotion, you could afford your own apartment.
- **Lin**: Wouldn't that just be more work? I don't like to **work at work**.
- **Lucy**: Please just apply.
- **Lin**: Fine.

Later that day, Lucy knocks on her 15-year-old neighbor Lily's door.

- **Lucy**: Lily, could you do me a favour?
- **Lily**: Let's say I help you. What would you do for me?
- **Lucy**: Tickets to see your favorite band?
- **Lily**: Hmm ... I'm listening.
- **Lucy**: Vikram is hiring a weekend manager. I want you to apply for the job and have a terrible interview so Vikram will give the job to Lin.
- **Lily**: But what would I do if he hired me?
- **Lucy**: I'll coach you so there's no way you'll get the job.
- **Lily**: Well, it's either this or homework ... I'll do it.

The next day, Lily and Lucy enter the bakery.

- **Lucy**: Remember your training. What'll you do during your interview.
- **Lily**: Insult Vikram's pastries and pretend to fall asleep.
- **Lucy**: Exactly.

As Lily goes to her interview, Lucy removes the hiring sign from the window of the bakery.

A man carrying a resume approaches Lucy.

- **Man**: I'm interviewing for the manager position!
- **Lucy**: You've got the wrong place. The new bakery across town is hiring.
- **Man**: What?! I'll be late for my interview!

The man quickly leaves. Lucy enters the bakery as Lily's interview finishes.

- **Vikram**: Sorry you don't like my pastries, Lily... but you're hired.
- **Lucy**: Lily got the job?
- **Vikram**: Lily is the only person who interviewed.

Just then, Lin enters the bakery.

- **Lucy**: Lin? Why didn't you interview?!
- **Lin**: I forgot.
- **Vikram**: Congratulations, Lily! You start at 4 a.m. on Saturday.
- **Lily**: 4 a.m.?!
- **Lin**: Wow, I'm glad I don't have your job, Lily.

## Writing

### Do you think Lily is going to like this job? Why or why not?

I believe that Lily will not like this job, since it starts too early. It needs to start work at 4 a.m.

I believe that Lily will not like this job, since it starts too early. **The job** starts at 4 a.m.

I believe that Lily won't like this job, which ~~needs to~~ get up at 4 a.m.

> Corrections:

1. “which needs to get up at 4 a.m.”
   - → unclear and grammatically incorrect. A **job** doesn’t "get up"; **a person does**.
2. Better phrasing: “which requires getting up at 4 a.m.” or “since it requires her to get up at 4 a.m.”

I believe that Lily won't like this job, since it requires getting up at 4 a.m.

I believe that Lily won't like this job, which **requires her** to get up at 4 a.m.

## Sentences

- 那不就是更多的工作了吗？我不喜欢在上班时真的工作。
  - Wouldn't that just be more work? I don't like to work at work.
