# The Hacker

Bea walks into Eddy's apartment.

- **Eddy**: Thanks for coming!
- **Bea**: **Sure**! You said there was a problem with your computer, right?
- **Eddy**: Yes!
- **Bea**: What happened?
- **Eddy**: Well … have you ever heard of a “hacker”?
  - That's a person who changes things on computers.
- **Bea**: Yes, Eddy, I know what a hacker is. So, what's the problem?
- **Eddy**: I tried to print my resume, but it didn't work!
  - And now I can't find my resume on my computer. I think the hacker deleted it.
- **Bea**: Can I look at it?

Bea starts working on the computer.

- **Bea**: OK, I found a file called “my resume.”

Bea opens the file. Eddy sees it on the computer.

- **Eddy**: It does look like my resume.
- **Bea**: Also, I know why your printer wasn't working.

Bea connects the printer to the computer.

- **Eddy**: It wasn't connected!
- **Bea**: Hmm. Junior probably did that.

The resume prints, and Bea looks at it.

- **Bea**: Eddy, there are mistakes all over your resume.
- **Eddy**: The hacker probably changed it!
- **Bea**: Hmm. Do you know that your resume says you're good **with** **computers**? (-s)
- **Eddy**: Yeah, the hacker definitely changed that.
