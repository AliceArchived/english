# The Fancy Hotel - B2

Bea and her friend Lin arrive at a stylish beach hotel in **Mexico**.

- **Bea**: You picked an amazing hotel, Lin! I thought you would've forgotten to do it.
- **Lin**: You only gave me one task. Anyway, why are we here so early? We can't even check in yet.
- **Bea**: You said this hotel has **complimentary** activities for guests! Would you rather go **snorkeling** or scuba diving now?
- **Lin**: I think I'll skip both. It's better to do nothing on vacation.

Bea approaches the hotel receptionist.

- **Bea**: We'd like to go snorkeling!
- **Receptionist**: That's $50 per person.
- **Bea**: Actually, we're guests!
- **Receptionist**: Oh, then it's complimentary!

Later, Bea is snorkeling while Lin floats on her back in the water.

- **Bea**: Isn't this incredible?!
- **Lin**: No. I'd rather be eating. All these fish are making me hungry.
- **Bea**: Fine, go to the hotel buffet while I check in.

Later, Bea gives the receptionist her ID at the front desk.

- **Bea**: Can I check in now?
- **Receptionist**: Hmm ... I'm not seeing a reservation under your name...
- **Bea**: Are you sure?

Lin **walks over** with a plate of food.

- **Lin**: I got some for you, too.

Lin points at her pocket, which is stuffed with crab legs.

- **Bea**: Lin, is the reservation under your name?
- **Lin**: No. You just told me to pick the hotel.
- **Bea**: You were supposed to book it! Now what will we do?!

Bea turns to the receptionist.

- **Bea**: Can we book a room, please?
- **Receptionist**: Unfortunately, we're **fully** booked.
- **Bea**: Lin, you had one task!

Bea and Lin drag their suitcases out of the hotel.

The receptionist runs after them.

- **Receptionist**: Wait!
- **Bea**: Did a room become available?
- **receptionist**: No... You forgot to pay for the activities and buffet.

He hands Bea a **large** bill. She looks shocked.

- **Lin**: I told you it's better to do nothing on vacation.

## Writing

### Do you prefer to do lots of activities or relax during a vacation? Explain your answer.

On a vacation, I prefer ~~relaxation style~~. For me, **vacation** should be relaxed and recover my energy. I heard some people ~~did~~ a busy vacation, but. when they back to work, they were exhausted. I don't **like** my vacation ~~ends~~ like that.

> Corrections:

1. **“relaxation style”**
   - → 不自然，应该说 **“a relaxing style”** 或 **“to relax”**
2. **“vacation should be relaxed”**
   - → 主语是 vacation，用 **“help me relax”** 或 **“should be relaxing”** 更自然
3. **“did a busy vacation”**
   - → 不地道，应该说 **“had a busy vacation”**
4. **“but. when they back to work”**
   - → 语法错误，应为 **“but when they went back to work”**
5. **“I don't like my vacation ends like that”**
   - → 时态结构错误，应为 **“I don’t want my vacation to end like that”**

On vacation, I prefer **a relaxing style**. For me, a vacation should help me **unwind** and **recover my energy**. **I’ve heard** of people who **had** busy vacations, but when they went back to work, they were exhausted. I don’t **want** my vacation **to** end like that.

在度假时，我更喜欢轻松的方式。对我来说，假期应该是放松和恢复精力的。我听说有些人假期安排得太满，结果一回去上班就精疲力尽。我不想让我的假期以那种方式结束。

### Formal Writing

更正式、逻辑清晰、适合写作考试（如 IELTS Writing Task 2 或 B2–C1 写作）的回答：

Personally, I prefer **a relaxing vacation** rather than one **filled with constant activities**. In my view, the main purpose of a vacation is to **take a break** from daily responsibilities, **reduce stress**, and **recharge** both **physically and mentally**. While some people enjoy a full schedule of sightseeing and events, I believe such vacations can be exhausting. I have heard of people returning from trips feeling even more tired than before. For me, an ideal vacation involves rest, peace, and enough time to truly recover — so I can return to work feeling refreshed and productive.

就我个人而言，我更喜欢轻松的假期，而不是安排满满的活动。在我看来，假期的主要目的是暂时摆脱日常责任、减压并让身心恢复。虽然有些人喜欢排得满满的行程和活动，但我认为那样反而让人疲惫。我听说过有人度假回来比之前还累。对我来说，理想的假期是有休息、有宁静、有真正恢复时间的假期——这样回到工作岗位时才能神清气爽，更有效率。

## Sentences

- 你说这家酒店为客人提供免费的活动！你现在想去浮潜还是潜水？
  - You said this hotel has **complimentary** activities for guests! Would you rather go **snorkeling** or scuba diving now?
- You picked an amazing hotel, Lin! I thought you would've forgotten to do it.
  - Grammatically fine, but **“would’ve forgotten”** is a bit awkward. For smoother phrasing:
    - → **“I thought you might forget to do it.”**
    - _(This is optional — your original is understandable, just slightly stiff.)_
- “stuffed with crab legs”
  - Correct, but **“pocket stuffed with crab legs”** is a funny visual — you might consider:
    - → **“crab legs sticking out of her pocket”** for clearer imagery
      _(Optional, for humor and clarity)_

## Vocabulary

- complimentary: 赠送的
- snorkeling: 浮潜
- stuffed: 塞满了
