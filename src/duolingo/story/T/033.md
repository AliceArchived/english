# The Eclipse - B2

Thousands of people are gathered in the countryside to see the most **anticipated** event of the year: **a solar eclipse**.

Eddy and his son, Junior, are having a barbecue, while their neighbor Oscar struggles to set up a **telescope** nearby.

- **Eddy**: Oscar, do you need help?
- **Oscar**: No, thanks. I can do it myself.

Oscar's telescope falls to the ground.

- **Oscar**: It must be broken.
- **Eddy**: Come hang out with me and Junior! We have music — and hot dogs!
- **Oscar**: I've been waiting to see this eclipse for years. I'd prefer to watch it silently with a glass of wine and some fine cheese — alone.

Oscar sets a plate of cheese on the ground for a picnic.

- **Eddy**: Oscar, you shouldn't put food on the ground here ...
- **Oscar**: I don't need your advice.

When Oscar turns his back, squirrels steal all his food. He **frowns**.

- **Eddy**: Are you sure you don't want a hot dog?
- **Oscar**: Eddy, I don't eat meat with artificial **flavoring**. (British: flavouring)
- **Eddy**: Me neither! They're 100% beef and 100% delicious!

Oscar looks unsure.

- **Eddy**: Just try one.

Oscar takes a bite.

- **Oscar**: Wow. This is ... delicious! I didn't know hot dogs could be so good.

Oscar quickly eats the hot dog.

- **Oscar**: It's as flavorful as Spanish ham! Could I have more?
- **Eddy**: Sure!

Oscar fills a plate with hot dogs and starts eating. Eddy checks his watch.

- **Eddy**: The eclipse is **set** to start in five minutes!

Oscar's stomach makes a loud noise.

- **Oscar**: Maybe I ate too many hot dogs.

Oscar runs into the bushes.

- **Junior**: Dad, the eclipse is starting!
- **Eddy**: Oscar is going to miss it!

A few minutes later, Oscar emerges from the bushes, covered in leaves, looking sick.

- **Oscar**: Did I miss the eclipse?
- **Eddy**: Yeah ... But there's good news. I have lots of hot dogs left!

## Writing

### Do you think Oscar regrets hanging out with Eddy? Why or why not?

In my opinion, Oscar must ~~regrets~~ hanging out with Eddy, since he got sick because he ate the hot dogs from Eddy.

In my opinion, Oscar must regret hanging out with Eddy, since he got sick because he ate hot dogs from Eddy.

> Correction:

1. “since he got sick because he ate hot dogs from Eddy”
   - → a bit wordy and slightly awkward. “Because” is already explained by “since,” so it’s redundant.
2. “hot dogs from Eddy”
   - → more natural to say “Eddy’s hot dogs” or “the hot dogs Eddy gave him.”

In my opinion, Oscar must **regret** hanging out with Eddy, **since** he got sick **after** eating the hot dogs Eddy gave him.

---

In my opinion, Oscar **definitely** regrets hanging out with Eddy since he waited **for** this eclipse for years, but Eddy's hot dogs ruined all the **expectations**.

> Correction:

1. **"expectations"** is not the best word here. "Expectations" refers to what someone hopes or believes will happen, but in this context, you're likely referring to the **experience** or the **moment** of the eclipse being ruined.
2. The phrase **"waited for this eclipse for years"** is grammatically fine but can be slightly improved for flow.

In my opinion, Oscar definitely regrets hanging out with Eddy, since he had waited for this eclipse for years, but Eddy's hot dogs ruined the whole **experience**.

> Polished:

Oscar definitely regrets hanging out with Eddy. He had been looking forward to this eclipse for years, but Eddy’s hot dogs completely **ruined the moment**.
