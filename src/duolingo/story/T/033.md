# The Contracts Class - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

Our school introduced a new contracts class for students who want to learn about legal agreements. Everyone says it's a great way to get tips on managing paperwork and understanding contracts, which will be useful for future jobs.

I hate it. There can't be anything more boring than learning about contracts. It's just a class where they teach you about long papers filled with rules and signatures. Basically, it's a nightmare for anyone who just wants to draw and listen to music.

This class requires us to work in teams to solve problems and manage projects. Sorry, did you say "team"? I'm not a person who likes working with others. I'd rather handle things **alone**, away from everyone else.

Plus, the teacher gives us tips on how to make good deals and manage contracts. It's supposed to be helpful. But there's the thing that I don't get: why would anyone choose to read big, boring contracts for fun? I think I'd rather watch paint dry.

We should drop the contracts class. Maybe some students will find it useful. But I don't need to know about contracts. I just want to listen to my music and draw alone.

合同课
Lily 的校报专栏

我们学校新开了一门“合同课”，专为想了解法律协议的学生设计。大家都说，这门课可以教你怎么处理文件、理解合同条款，对将来的工作很有帮助。

但我超讨厌这门课。没有什么比学合同更无聊的了。这课就是让你看一堆写满规则和签名的长文件。对那些只想画画、听音乐的人来说，简直就是噩梦。

这门课还要求我们分组完成项目、解决问题。等等，你说“团队”？我就不是那种喜欢和别人一起干活的人。我更喜欢独自一人，离所有人远远的。

老师还会教我们怎么谈成好交易、管理合同，听起来好像挺实用。但我实在搞不懂：怎么会有人觉得看冗长又无聊的合同是件有趣的事？我宁愿去看油漆干的过程。

我们根本不该上这门课。也许有些学生觉得有用，但我可不需要懂什么合同。我只想听我的音乐，一个人静静地画画。

## Style

- "Basically, it's a nightmare for anyone who just wants to draw and listen to music."
  - Style suggestion: "For someone who just wants to draw and listen to music, it's a nightmare."
  - **Avoids starting with “Basically,”** which weakens tone; improves clarity.
- "Sorry, did you say 'team'?"
  - Style suggestion: "**Wait** — did you say 'team'?" -** “Sorry” can sound passive or unclear in tone**; “Wait” adds clearer sarcasm and matches the narrator’s voice better.
- "But **there's** the thing that I don't get:"
  - Style suggestion: "But **here's** what I don't get:"
  - Smoother phrasing; “there’s the thing” is clunky and informal even for casual tone.

## Sentences

- This class **requires** us to work in teams to solve problems and manage projects.
  - requires: needs

## Speaking & Writing

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

Lily dislikes the contracts class, and honestly, I can **relate**. I think it’s mainly because she doesn’t have enough real-world experience yet. She’s still very young and deeply immersed in her own world of painting and music. That creative focus might make it harder for her to see the value in learning about contracts, which are often viewed as dry or overly technical. However, once she starts facing real-life responsibilities, I believe she’ll understand how useful that knowledge can be.

Lily 不喜欢这门合同课，说实话我能理解。我觉得主要原因是她还缺乏现实世界的经验。她年纪还轻，而且一直沉浸在自己的绘画和音乐世界中。正因为她专注于创作领域，可能更难理解学习合同的重要性，毕竟合同常被视为枯燥或太技术化的内容。不过，一旦她开始面对现实生活中的责任，我相信她就会明白这些知识有多实用。

> Explanation:

Natural fluency and tone suitable for IELTS Speaking

Variety of expressions: "deeply immersed," "dry or overly technical"

Balanced opinion with both empathy and logic

Clear organization: reason → explanation → future reflection

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

I believe Lily dislikes the contracts class mainly because she lacks practical life experience, which makes the subject feel distant and hard to relate to. Contracts often involve real-world scenarios, and without exposure to those, it can seem irrelevant or even confusing. In addition, maybe she struggled to work with her classmates during group tasks, which might have made the class less enjoyable. In my opinion, contracts are a part of everyday life — from renting an apartment to getting a job — so learning about them is actually very useful.

我认为 Lily 不喜欢这门合同课，主要是因为她缺乏实际生活经验，这让这门课显得遥远而难以理解。合同常常涉及现实生活中的场景，如果没有这些经验，就很容易觉得这门课无关紧要，甚至令人困惑。此外，她在小组任务中可能也缺乏合作能力，这也可能使课堂变得不那么有趣。在我看来，合同在日常生活中无处不在——从租房到找工作——所以学习它其实非常有用。

> Explanation:

This version meets IELTS Speaking Band 7+ criteria:

- Lexical resource: Uses a range of vocabulary like “exposure,” “distant,” “irrelevant,” and “struggled.”
- Grammatical range: Includes conditionals, complex sentences, and clear referencing.
- Fluency and coherence: Ideas are clearly linked and logically developed.
- Task response: Fully addresses the question with elaboration.

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

I think Lily dislikes the contracts class mainly because she doesn't have enough **real-world experience** to understand its importance. When people **haven’t yet** dealt with contracts in real life — like renting an apartment or signing up for services — it's hard to see why they matter. Maybe she also had trouble working with others, which made the class more frustrating. In my opinion, learning about contracts is essential, because in real life, avoiding them is nearly impossible.

我认为 Lily 不喜欢合同课，主要是因为她没有足够的现实生活经验，无法理解它的重要性。当一个人还没有经历过真实的合同，比如租房或注册服务时，很难意识到合同的意义。也许她在课堂上与他人合作不顺利，这让她更反感这门课。在我看来，了解合同是非常必要的，因为在现实生活中，几乎无法避免接触合同。

> Reasons

this answer is more suitable for IELTS Speaking, not Writing.

- Tone and Style: The informal and conversational tone (“I think”, “maybe”, “it’s hard to see”) fits Speaking well but is too casual for Writing Task 2, which requires a more academic and formal tone.
- Structure: The answer flows naturally and uses contractions ("doesn't", "haven’t") and personal opinions — features encouraged in Speaking but discouraged in Writing Task 2.
- Content: The explanation is relevant, coherent, and includes an example (contracts in real life), which supports IELTS Speaking Part 3 well.

### 🌟 Writing Band 7.0+

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

It seems that Lily dislikes the contracts class, and I can understand her **perspective**. She appears to be a young student who is more focused on creative pursuits like painting and music. As a result, she might not yet see the relevance of contracts in her daily life. Additionally, a lack of exposure to real-life challenges could make the course feel unrelatable or even tedious. However, contracts are a fundamental part of adult life — from signing a rental agreement to starting a job. In time, she may realize that this class equips her with skills that are essential for independence.

Lily 似乎不喜欢这门合同课，我可以理解她的想法。她看起来是一个年轻的学生，更专注于绘画和音乐等创作领域。因此，她可能还没有意识到合同在日常生活中的重要性。此外，缺乏现实生活经验也会让这门课显得难以理解，甚至有些枯燥。然而，合同在成年生活中无处不在——从签租房合同到开始工作。随着时间的推移，她可能会意识到这门课程实际上是在为她的独立生活提供必要的技能。

> Explanation:

Strong coherence: Each sentence builds on the previous one logically.

Balanced tone: Shows empathy toward Lily but also highlights real-life importance.

Wide lexical resource: Uses formal phrases like “creative pursuits,” “lack of exposure,” “equips her with skills.”

Grammatical accuracy: Includes conditionals and compound-complex sentences, aligning with Band 7+ requirements.

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

Lily seems to dislike the contracts class, and I believe this may be due to a lack of real-world experience. Without encountering situations where contracts play a major role — such as signing leases or employment agreements — it’s understandable that the subject may feel abstract or unnecessary to her. Furthermore, she might not have engaged actively in group activities, which can make a course less enjoyable and harder to follow. In everyday life, however, understanding contracts is extremely important. Whether we are renting, buying, or working, we are constantly dealing with legal agreements, so this course offers valuable skills for the future.

Lily 似乎不喜欢这门合同课，我认为这可能是因为她缺乏现实生活经验。如果没有经历过需要合同的重要场合，比如签租房合同或就业协议，就很容易觉得这门课抽象甚至没有必要。此外，她可能在小组活动中没有积极参与，这也会让课程变得枯燥难以跟进。然而，在日常生活中，理解合同极为重要。无论是租房、买东西，还是工作，我们都经常处理各种法律协议，因此这门课为未来提供了宝贵的技能。

> Explanation:

This writing sample fits IELTS Band 7+ standards:

- Task achievement: Directly addresses the question with clear, supported arguments.
- Coherence and cohesion: Smooth transitions between ideas (e.g., "Furthermore", "However").

### Practice History

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

Helpful Phrases: Lily dislikes it/ I think she/ Maybe it's because

Lily dislikes the ~~constract~~ class, which I can totally understand. I think she just doesn't have enough life experience. Maybe it's because she is so young and **dives into** her painting and music world and hasn't **dealt** with enough **real-life** stuff.

> Corrections:

1. Word choice: “dives into” is informal and slightly awkward here — “is immersed in” fits better for describing **long-term engagement**.
2. Grammar: “dealt” → needs to be followed by “with”, as “deal” is usually used with a preposition.
3. Clarity: “real-life stuff” → better academic tone is “**real-life situations**” or “**practical matters**”.

Lily dislikes the contracts class, which I can totally understand. I think she just doesn't have enough life experience. Maybe it's because she is so young and **immersed in** her painting and music world and hasn't **dealt** with enough **real-life situations**.

Lily 不喜欢这门合同课，我完全可以理解。我认为她只是没有足够的生活经验。也许是因为她还太年轻，总是沉浸在她的绘画和音乐世界里，还没有真正处理过多少现实生活中的事务。

- immersed: 英 /ɪ'mɜːst/, 美 /ɪ'mɜːst/
  - adj. 专注的；浸入的
  - v. 沉湎于；浸（immerse 的过去式和过去分词）

Lily dislikes the contract class which I think she just doesn't have enough practical life experiences. Maybe it's because she didn't cooperate with others enough. In real life, I can't imagine anyone **avoiding** contracts.

> Corrections:

1. "which I think she just doesn't have…" is grammatically awkward.
2. The sentence needed clearer structure — the em dash was not misused, but clearer punctuation was required.
3. “contract class” should be “**contracts class**” to match the story title.
4. "which I think is because…" improves clarity and coherence.

Lily dislikes **the contracts class**, which I think **is because** she **lacks** enough practical life **experience**. Maybe it's **also** because she didn’t cooperate with others enough. In real life, I can't imagine anyone **avoiding** contracts.

Lily 不喜欢合同课，我认为是因为她缺乏足够的实际生活经验。也许是因为她没有很好地与他人合作。在现实生活中，我无法想象有人会回避合同。

> Corrections:

1. "is because" is grammatically acceptable, but “might be because” sounds more natural in spoken or written English.
2. "didn’t cooperate with others enough" is fine, but could be rephrased as "didn’t collaborate much" for conciseness.
3. “avoiding contracts” is okay, but “avoiding dealing with contracts” may better reflect the meaning.
