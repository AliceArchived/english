# The Coolest Bakery - B2

As Vikram sweeps the floor of his bakery, he sees his friend Bea walking by.

- **Vikram**: Bea! Would you like to buy some **pastries**? I'll give you a discount!
- **Bea**: No, thanks ...

Bea hides a box behind her back.

- **Vikram**: What's that?
- **Bea**: They're ... pastries from Cool Joe's Bakery.
- **Vikram**: You went to that **trendy** new bakery?! They're taking all of my business.
- **Bea**: Sorry! They look cool on social media. They have a neon sign and a DJ!
- **Vikram**: I can't compete with that.
- **Bea**: Don't worry. I'll help you!

A few days later, Eddy enters Vikram's bakery.

Vikram is **DJing**, and the bakery is extremely crowded. All the customers are taking photos of the pastries, which are now heart-shaped and covered in **neon** frosting.

- **Eddy**: Vikram, this is awesome!
- **Vikram**: I know! I forgot how much fun DJing is!
- **Eddy**: How did you get all of these people here?
- **Vikram**: Bea helped! She's really good at social media.

Eddy **gets in line**, but the line doesn't move. Then he tries to find a place to sit, but the bakery is too crowded.

- **Eddy**: Hey, Vikram! It's too busy here. I'll see you later!
- **Vikram**: Hmm ... My bakery is so busy that I'm losing my favorite customers ... Maybe having such a cool bakery wasn't a good idea.

Vikram watches **as** a man takes a selfie with a donut and then throws the donut away.

- **Vikram**: I can't believe this! People aren't even eating my pastries. They're just taking pictures!

The next day, Vikram's bakery returns to normal. Eddy enters, buys a **croissant**, and takes a picture of it.

- **Vikram**: If you don't post that picture on social media, I'll give you a free croissant.
- **Eddy**: You've got a deal!

## Writing

### In the end, Vikram changed his bakery back to normal. Do you think that was a good decision? Why or why not?

> Correction:

- "somethings"
  - 应为 "some things"（注意空格）。
- “then they can figure out…”
  - “then” 建议替换为**更正式**的连接词如 “so that”。
- “It is sure that Vikram already knows…”
  - 句式不自然，应改为 “It’s clear that...” 或 “I’m sure that...”
- 最后一句 “does things according to his preference”
  - 稍显生硬，可优化为更自然表达。

Yes, I think that **was** a good decision. People need to experience **some things** so that they can figure out what they really like and make their own **choices**. **I'm sure** that Vikram already knows what he wants and **is doing** things **based on** his own preferences.

是的，我认为这是一个明智的决定。人们需要经历一些事情，才能弄清楚自己真正喜欢什么，并做出属于自己的选择。我相信 Vikram 已经清楚自己想要什么，并且正在按照自己的喜好去做事。
