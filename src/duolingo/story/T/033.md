# The Breakup

Lucy is leaving for a date. Her granddaughter Lin is watching TV.

- **Lin**: Say hello to Sam for me!
- **Lucy**: It will be a short dinner. I'm going to break up with him.
- **Lin**: What? You **spend** so much time together!
- **Lucy**: That's the problem!
  - He wants to see me every day. But I want to be alone more often.

At the cafe, Lucy finds her boyfriend, Sam.

- **Sam**: Hi, my love.
- **Lucy**: We need to talk.
- **Sam**: Before you say anything else, you should know that I really like you.
- **Lucy**: I really like you too.
- **Sam**: But we should break up.
- **Lucy**: **You're breaking up with** me?
- **Sam**: I have to move to Barcelona for work…
  - And I can only see you a few times a year.
- **Lucy**: That's perfect!
- **Sam**: **It is**?
- **Lucy**: I wanted to break up with you because I need more independence.
  - But now that's not a problem!
- **Sam**: So … we're staying together?
- **Lucy**: Yes! When are you leaving?
- **Sam**: Saturday.
- **Lucy**: Great! I'll drive you to the airport!
