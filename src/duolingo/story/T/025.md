# The Bull-Riding Plan - B3

Bea and Eddy are chatting on a bench by the local park. Bea is excitedly waving papers around.

- **Bea**: Eddy, I've done it! I'm organizing a bull-riding competition. It's going to be huge — a ranch theme with sponsors, prizes, and an announcer!
- **Eddy**: A ranch theme? Why not just have cows and **call it a day**?
- **Bea**: No, Eddy! This will **blow everyone away**! I've planned **food trucks**, **fancy costumes**, and **a big stage**. It's all on this list.

Eddy looks at the long list and **scratches** his head.

- **Eddy**: Bea, this sounds complicated.
- **Bea**: It has to be! People will love it. I even rented a real bull!
- **Eddy**: Wait — you rented a bull? What happens if it gets loose?
- **Bea**: Don't worry! I'll have security.

Eddy looks over at the park and sees a mechanical bull being set up for a kid's birthday party.

- **Eddy**: Hey, that's a good idea. A fake bull. No risk of getting thrown off.
- **Bea**: Eddy, this is a competition, not a birthday party!

At that moment, people walking by see the mechanical bull and head toward it, excited.

- **Eddy**: Hmm. Maybe I'll start my own "bull-riding challenge" here. Pizza for prizes!

Bea watches as more people line up at the mechanical bull.

- **Bea**: Eddy, this is ridiculous! No ranch theme, no sponsors, no announcer!
- **Eddy**: Nope, just balloons, pizza, and no real bulls.

Bea sighs as Eddy hands out snacks to the cheering crowd.

- **Bea**: Next time, I'm renting two bulls.
- **Eddy**: Sure, Bea. Let me know how that goes.

**What did Bea rent for the competition?**

For the bull-riding competition, Bea **went to great lengths** by renting an actual bull rather than using a mechanical one. **Anticipating** the risks, she also arranged for a security guard to be present in case the bull managed to break free. Her decision highlighted both her **determination** to make the event **authentic** and her awareness of the potential dangers involved.

为了骑牛比赛，Bea 不惜重金租了一头真正的公牛，而不是使用机械牛。考虑到可能的风险，她还安排了一名保安在场，以防公牛逃脱。她的决定既体现了她追求比赛真实性的决心，也表现出她对潜在危险的警觉。

### Practice History

**What did Bea rent for the competition?**

Helpful Phrases: Bea rented/ for the/ get loose

Bea rented a real bull for the bull riding competition. She even hired a security guard in case the bull **gets** loose.

> Corrections:

1. The verb tense "gets" should match the past narrative, so it should be changed to "got" to stay consistent with "rented" and "hired." Also, "bull riding" should be hyphenated when used as a compound adjective.

Bea rented a real bull for the bull-riding competition. She even hired a security guard in case the bull **got** loose.

Bea 为骑牛比赛租了一头真正的公牛。她甚至雇了一名保安，以防公牛跑掉。
