# The Action Figure - B2

Junior and his dad, Eddy, knock on the front door of a house. A man answers the door.

- **Junior**: Hello, we used to live here, and I need to look in my old room.

Before the man can respond, Junior walks in.

- **Man**: Excuse me!
- **Eddy**: I'm sorry! We moved out three years ago, and my son thinks he left a toy behind.
- **Man**: I would've thrown it out. I don't like toys ... or children.
- **Junior**: Please let me check! The "Space Viking" action figure with a special shield is very valuable.
- **Man**: I don't care. You have to leave.
- **Junior**: But we could share the profit with you.
- **Man**: **Profits**? Fine, but be quick.

Eddy and Junior enter Junior's old room.

- **Junior**: The guy turned my old room into a stupid gym.
- **Eddy**: Wow! He has the most expensive **stationary bike** on the market!
  - I'll just ride it for five minutes. He won't mind...

While Eddy gets on the bike, Junior finds a loose **floorboard** and lifts it up.

- **Junior**: I'm not sure, but I think I hid it under the floorboards ...

Junior removes another floorboard as Eddy **pedals** faster.

- **Eddy**: This bike is incredible!

Junior reaches under the floorboards and pulls out an action figure.

- **Junior**: We're rich.
- **Eddy**: Great!
  - I can buy one of these bikes!

Junior examines the action figure.

- **Junior**: Wait, this isn't the one with the shield! It's the one with the **ax**. It's not rare! It's worthless.
  - We shouldn't have wasted our time coming here.

The man walks in. He sees Eddy riding the bike and a hole in the floor.

- **Man**: What are you doing?!

Eddy falls off the bike and breaks the pedal.

- **Eddy**: This is embarrassing...
- **Man**: You'll have to pay for the damage to the floor and the bike!
- **Junior**: But we didn't bring any money.
- **Man**: Then you should give me your valuable action figure!
- **Junior**: You've got a deal!

## Vocabulary

- stationary bike: 动感单车
- floorboard: 地板条
- pedal: vt 踩...的踏板

## Sentences

- **“Profits?”**
  - Consider changing to:
    - **“Profit?”**
    - Since Junior only mentioned **sharing the profit** (singular), not multiple forms of income.
    - But both are acceptable in casual speech depending on tone.

**What happened in the story?**

In this story, Eddy and Junior visited the apartment they used to live in three years ago. Junior wanted to **recover** an old action figure he had hidden under the floorboard because figures with shields **have become** valuable. However, he only found one with an axe, which wasn’t worth anything. **While** Junior was searching, Eddy broke the stationary bike by pedaling too hard. The **current tenant** got angry and demanded the toy in return for the damage. In the end, Junior gave him the action figure.

在这个故事中，Eddy 和 Junior 回到了他们三年前住过的公寓。Junior 想找回自己藏在地板下的一个动作玩偶，因为带盾牌的玩偶现在很值钱。但他只找到一个带斧头的玩偶，没有什么价值。在 Junior 寻找玩具的时候，Eddy 骑固定脚踏车时太用力，把它弄坏了。现在的房客很生气，并要求用那个玩偶来赔偿。最后，Junior 把玩偶给了他。

why did I say "tenant"?

I used "current tenant" because:

1. It avoids assuming ownership.
2. In everyday English, "tenant" just means a person who lives there now, whether they rent or own.
3. It keeps the story neutral and accurate since we don’t know if he owns the place.

### Practice History

**What happened in the story?**

In the story, Eddy and Junior went back to their old apartment where they moved out three years ago. Junior wanted to find his action figure under the floorboard because the action figures with shield are valueable now. But he found an action figure with ax which are ~~valueless~~. While Junior tried to find his action figure, Eddy was ~~peddling~~ the stationary bike and broke it. The owner was upset and asked them for the action figure. Junior agreed.

> Corrections:

1. “where they moved out three years ago” → better: **“which** they **had** moved out of three years ago”
2. “with shield are valueable” → spelling error: **“valuable”**; and “figures with shields are” → singular/plural mismatch
3. “with ax which are valueless” → should be “with an **axe**, which is **worthless”**
4. “was peddling” → should be **“pedaling”**
5. “asked them for the action figure” → unclear; better to say “asked for the action figure as compensation”

In the story, Eddy and Junior went back to their old apartment, **which** they **had moved out** of three years ago. Junior wanted to find his action figure under the floorboard because action figures with shields are **valuable** now. But he found an action figure with an **axe**, which is **worthless**. While Junior was looking for his toy, Eddy was **riding** the stationary bike and accidentally broke it. The owner **got upset** and asked for the action figure as **compensation**. Junior agreed.

- compensation: 英 /ˌkɒmpenˈseɪʃn/, 美 /ˌkɑːmpenˈseɪʃn/
  - n. 补偿[赔偿]物, 补偿[赔偿]金

- "... which they had moved out **of** three years ago"
  - ❌ Incorrect phrase: "which they had moved out three years ago"
    - This is incorrect because the verb "move out" is a phrasal verb that requires the preposition "of" when it has an object (in this case, "which", referring to the apartment).
- Why "move out of"?
  - "move out" by itself means "to leave a place where you live":
    - "I moved out last year." ✅ (No object needed.)
  - But if you want to say what you moved out of, you must add "of":
    - "I moved out of the apartment last year." ✅
    - "They moved out of the house three years ago." ✅
