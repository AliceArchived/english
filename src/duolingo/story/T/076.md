# The Sandwich Thief

Eddy is in the kitchen at the office where he works.

He is talking to his new colleague, Elena.

- **Eddy**: **Ugh**! It happened again!
- **Elena**: What?
- **Eddy**: Someone **stole** my lunch!
  - This **has happened** every day for the **past week**!
- **Elena**: Really? That's strange.
- **Eddy**: I think Phil has been stealing my food.
- **Elena**: Yeah, Phil always looks hungry.
- **Eddy**: He stole my ham sandwich yesterday!
- **Elena**: Do you mean your chicken sandwich?
  - You brought a ham sandwich on Tuesday.
- **Eddy**: What? **How** do you know that?
- **Elena**: Uh … I'm good at guessing!
- **Eddy**: Well, I have a surprise for Phil tomorrow.
  - I'm going to bring a **disgusting** fish and banana sandwich!
- **Elena**: Good plan.

**The next day, Eddy sees Elena again.**

- **Eddy**: No one stole my lunch today!
- **Elena**: **But** that's a good thing, right?
- **Eddy**: No, I only brought that fish and banana sandwich… so now I have to eat it.
- **Elena**: Well, I have a delicious turkey sandwich today.
- **Eddy**: Really? You don't usually bring your lunch.
- **Elena**: Well, I'm **allergic** to **bananas**. (-s)
- **Eddy**: Wait… It was you!
