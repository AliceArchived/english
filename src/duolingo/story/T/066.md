# The Password

Lucy is looking at her computer.

- **Lucy**: Lin! I can't log into my computer! I forgot my password.
- **Lin**: OK, I'll look at it… The password hint is "The name of your first love."
- **Lucy**: Hm…
  - Well, when I was a spy…
  - I had to bring some medicine over the border…
- **Lin**: What?
- **Lucy**: At the time, I was working with a man named Eduardo…
- **Lin**: Eduardo?

Lin types the name into the computer.

- **Lin**: That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: No, I never loved Eduardo. He was stupid.
  - Because of Eduardo, the enemies caught us.
  - They took us to a secret room in the embassy.
- **Lin**: Uh-oh.
- **Lucy**: The enemy leader came to see me. We spent days talking. Finally, he let us leave.
- **Lin**: Oh, really?
- **Lucy**: We became good friends.
- **Lin**: What was his name?
- **Lucy**: Jean-Luc.

Lin types the name into the computer.

- **Lin**: That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: He gave me money to get on a plane.
- **Lin**: Then what happened?
- **Lucy**: Well… The **pilot** was a very handsome young man.
  - Kind, funny, smart… his name was **Rafael**.
- **Lin**: I'll try "Rafael" … no. That's not the password.
- **Lucy**: No, Rafael died.
- **Lin**: What?
- **Lucy**: He had a heart attack while we were flying.
- **Lin**: Oh no!
- **Lucy**: His last words were, "Take care of the Black Rose."
  - And I did.
- **Lin**: What's the Black Rose?
- **Lucy**: The airplane. It was the most beautiful plane in the world.
- **Lin**: Black Rose! Yes! That's the password!

## Speaking

Lucy was a spy. What kind of work are you interested in? Why?

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

I'm interested in becoming **a quantitative trader**, mainly because I'm fascinated by the financial markets and data analysis. It’s a career that combines mathematics, programming, and fast decision-making, which I find both challenging and exciting. Of course, one of the main motivations is the potential to earn a high income. However, I have to admit that given my current age and background, achieving this goal might be difficult. Still, I believe that with consistent effort and the right training, it’s not entirely out of reach.

我想成为一名量化交易员，主要是因为我对金融市场和数据分析非常着迷。这份工作融合了数学、编程和快速决策能力，我觉得既有挑战性又很刺激。当然，高收入也是我感兴趣的一个重要原因。不过我必须承认，以我目前的年龄和背景来看，实现这个目标可能有些困难。但我相信只要持续努力并接受正确的训练，这个梦想并非遥不可及。

Lucy was a spy. What kind of work are you interested in? Why?

I want to be a quantan trader. I can earn lots of money. But for my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream.

> Corrections:

1. "quantan trader"
   - → typo: should be "**quant trader**" (short for **quantitative** trader).
2. "I can earn lots of money."
   - → grammatically fine, but more natural phrasing is "because it can be very profitable."
3. "But for my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream."
   - → better phrased as "But at my age, it seems impossible to achieve that dream."
