# This Week's School Highlights - B2

By Ricky Mathis, School Newspaper Editor

It's been another fun-filled week at the high school, the highlight of which was the annual Autumn Dance! The head of the event planning **committee**, Zari, decorated the entire gym by herself.

When asked to comment, Zari said:

- **Zari**: I wanted to make the gym look like a beach and it only took eighteen hours!
  - But then it took thirty-six hours to sweep up all the sand.

In other news, our soccer team won their game on Monday, in spite of **an equipment mix-up**. Team captain and **goalie**, Zari, who was mysteriously covered in sand, apologized:

- **Zari**: I don't know how I brought basketballs instead of soccer balls.
  - I must have been exhausted.

**Spectators** noted that the team's defense was excellent, especially considering that the **goalie** took a nap during the game.

Finally, the school play **premiered** this Wednesday. Everyone was amazed by the unique performance of the director and star of the play, Zari.

Usually, Hamlet is three hours long, but Zari's quick **delivery of the lines** shortened the play to forty-five minutes.

Zari mentioned that her performance was due to the energy drink she had before the show.

Unfortunately, Zari was unable to answer further questions because she had fallen asleep during our interview.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Do you think it's good for Zari to do so many things at once? Why?**

In my **view**, it’s not a good idea for Zari to try to **handle** so many things at once. As a student, she should **put her studies** first. Of course, taking part in a few activities can be good for her, but it would be better if she just picked a couple of the ones she enjoys the most so she can still get enough rest.

在我看来，Zari 同时做这么多事情并不是一个好主意。作为一名学生，她应该把学业放在首位。当然，参加一些活动对她有好处，但最好是挑选一两项她最喜欢的，这样她也能保证有足够的休息时间。

### Practice History

**Do you think it's good for Zari to do so many things at once? Why?**

In my opinion, it is bad for Zari to do so many things at once. She is a student, so she should **focus** on her **studies**. **Doing** some activities **would be** good for her, so she can **choose** just some of the most interesting activities and have enough time for sleep.

> Corrections:

1. “it is bad for Zari to do so many things at once” 可以更自然地表达为 “**it’s not a good idea** for Zari to try to do so many things at once”，让语气更口语化。
2. “so she can choose just some of the most interesting activities and have enough time for sleep” 的 and 可以用 to ensure 让句子衔接更流畅。

In my opinion, **it’s not a good idea** for Zari to **try to do** so many things at once. She is a student, so she should focus on her studies. Doing some activities **would be** good for her, but she should **choose** just **a few of** the most interesting **ones** to **make sure** she has enough time for sleep.

在我看来，Zari 同时做这么多事情并不是个好主意。她是学生，所以应该专注于学业。参加一些活动对她是有益的，但她最好只选择几项最感兴趣的活动，以确保有足够的睡眠时间。
