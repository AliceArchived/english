# The Wrong Duck

**Eddy is talking to a waitress at a restaurant.**

- **Eddy**: Is the food here good? It all looks … **really** expensive.
- **Waitress**: Yes, it's not cheap, but we're one of the best restaurants in town.
- **Eddy**: OK. I really want my **date** to like me.
- **Waitress**: Are you sure she's coming? You've been waiting for an hour.
- **Eddy**: She said to meet at the Blue Duck at 7 p.m.
- **Waitress**: Oh. This is the Black Duck.
- **Eddy**: What? This isn't the Blue Duck?!
- **Waitress**: No, but the Blue Duck isn't far from here.
- **Eddy**: Maybe she's still there!

Eddy runs to the Blue Duck. He sees a waitress. (Waiter)

- **Eddy**: Excuse me. Did you see a tall woman with dark hair waiting here?
- **Waitress**: Yes… but her date never arrived.
  - I told her to go to the Black Duck. I think her date is there.
- **Eddy**: Oh no!

Eddy runs back to the Black Duck. His date is outside the restaurant.

- **Eddy**: Georgia! I'm glad that I found you! Let's go eat.
- **Georgia**: The restaurant just closed.
- **Eddy**: I'm so sorry…
- **Georgia**: It's OK. Let's have burgers across the street.
  - This place is too expensive anyway!
- **Eddy**: I think I'm in love.
