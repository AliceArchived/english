# The Vintage Jacket - B2

Eddy leads his son, Junior, through an outdoor market that is selling used clothing. Junior reluctantly follows him.

- **Junior**: Why are we here, Dad?
- **Eddy**: You need a new jacket, and vintage clothes are cool!
- **Junior**: These clothes aren't cool. They smell weird.
- **Eddy**: Vintage clothes are much higher quality compared to new clothes nowadays. And they're cheaper!
- **Junior**: But the coolest kid at my school, Damian, always wears new clothes. I've never even seen him wear the same jacket twice.
- **Eddy**: Well, his parents must be rich. Let's find one good jacket that you can wear every day.

Eddy and Junior search through **racks** of old clothes.

Junior finds a leather jacket covered in metal **spikes**.

- **Junior**: What about this one? It's pretty cheap!
- **Eddy**: Kids **wore** jackets like that when I was in high school ... but I don't think so, Junior. I don't want you to accidentally stab someone.

Eddy **holds up** a very brightly colored jacket.

- **Eddy**: Bold colors were very popular in the 80s. You could **bring back this trend**!
- **Junior**: Dad, **looking at that jacket hurts my eyes**!
- **Eddy**: Just try it on!

Junior reluctantly tries on the jacket.

- **Junior**: I look like a rainbow.
- **Eddy**: But you're getting so many colors for your money!

Eddy looks at the price.

- **Eddy**: Wait ... How could this cost more than a new jacket?!

Suddenly Junior notices Damian, the cool kid from his class, walking towards them.

- **Junior**: Damian can't see me in this jacket!

Junior struggles to take off the jacket.

- **Damian**: Cool jacket, Junior.
  - I wish I could wear vintage clothes, but my parents are always buying me new stuff.
- **Junior**: Dad, I know it's expensive, but Damian likes it! Please buy me this jacket!
- **Eddy**: I changed my mind. You know what's always cool? Leather and spikes!

## Writing

### Which jacket would you have gotten? Why?

I would not have bought any of these jackets. They were used, which I really don't like. And the color looked like rainbow, there were no way I could bought a rainbow jacket.

> Corrections:

1. **"there were no way"**
   - → 应为 **"there was no way"**（“way” 是单数）。
2. **"could bought"**
   - → 应为 **"could have bought"**（虚拟语气中应使用完成式）。

I would not have bought any of these jackets. They were used, which I really do not like. And the color looked like a rainbow. **There was** no way I **could have bought** a rainbow jacket.

我不会买这些夹克中的任何一件。它们是二手的，而我真的不喜欢二手衣物。而且颜色像彩虹一样，我根本不可能买一件彩虹夹克。

### Rewritted Version

I **would have gotten** the brightly colored jacket. At first, I might have thought it looked strange, but once someone like Damian — the coolest kid at school — said it was cool, I would definitely want it. It’s unique, and sometimes being bold makes you stand out in a good way.

我会选择那件颜色鲜艳的夹克。一开始我可能会觉得它有点奇怪，但如果像 Damian 这样最酷的同学说它很酷，那我肯定也会想要。它很特别，有时候大胆一点能让人以好的方式脱颖而出。

I would not **have gotten** any of the jackets. I do not like used clothes, and the brightly colored one looked ridiculous to me. I would feel embarrassed wearing something that makes me look like a rainbow, even if someone else thinks it’s cool.

我不会买任何一件夹克。我不喜欢二手衣服，而且那件颜色鲜艳的夹克对我来说看起来很滑稽。即使别人觉得它很酷，我穿起来也会觉得尴尬，像彩虹一样太夸张了。
