# Talent Show - B2

Lily and Zari are selecting performers for their school's talent show. Lily looks at the list and **yawns**.

- **Lily**: All these acts are boring.
- **Zari**: Lily, you've rejected every performer. We need to accept some acts for the show, or we'll be the **only ones performing**.
- **Lily**: But if the other acts are bad, the audience will leave before our band gets to play.
- **Zari**: If we don't pick another **act**, we won't have a show at all.
- **Lily**: Fine. Let's see the next audition.

A girl comes to the stage on a **unicycle**, holding two soccer balls.

- **Lily**: No. Next!

A boy dressed as a **mime** walks on stage and begins to **juggle**.

- **Lily**: A **juggling mime**? Mimes aren't supposed to have **props**.
- **Zari**: Just give him a chance!

As he's juggling, one of the balls lands on the boy's head. He opens his mouth to scream, but no sound comes out.

- **Zari**: He's a bad **juggler**, but at least he's a good **mime**.
- **Lily**: We're not putting him in the show.
- **Zari**: We need other acts besides our band, Lily!

The next act enters. It's two girls, Millie and Ari. Ari **tunes** her guitar while Millie sets up her drums.

- **Zari**: Hey! They kind of look like us!
  - But ... cooler?
- **Lily**: And they have the drum set I've been saving money to buy.

Millie and Ari start to play **a fast-paced rock song**.

- **Lily**: Wow. They're actually pretty good. They might even be better than us.
- **Zari**: Oh no ... Do you really think so?
- **Lily**: Yeah, I guess we finally found another act for the show.
- **Zari**: Absolutely not!
- **Lily**: What? Why? They're amazing.
- **Zari**: They're too good. If we play after them, we'll look terrible in **comparison**.
- **Lily**: Hmm, maybe you're right. Let's bring back the mime.

## Writing

### What happened in the story?

In the story, Lily and Zari wanted to find some players to play with them in a school talent show. At first, they wanted to find someone who **was** really **talented**. But when they did find someone who **was** really talented — even better than themselves — they decided to use someone who was not good enough.

> Corrections:

1. “She rejected performers she didn't think they were good.”
   - → 重复主语结构，应简化为：**She rejected performers she didn’t think were good.**
2. “in the end when she really found someone were actually better”
   - → **someone** 是单数，不能搭配 **were**，应为 **was**。
3. “actually better”
   - 搭配模糊，建议更自然地表达为 “was actually very good” 或 “turned out to be really talented”。
4. “to make their own performance look worse”
   - → 建议改为 **because they didn’t want their own performance to look worse**，表达更清晰自然。
5. “they decided to choose the mine”
   - → **the mine** 不符合上下文，应为 **the mime**（哑剧表演）。

In the story, Lily wanted to find good performers at first. She rejected **the ones** she thought **were not good**. But in the end, when she found **someone** who **was** actually very talented, she and Zari thought the act was too good and might make their own performance look worse — so they decided to **go with** the mime instead.

故事中，一开始 Lily 想找一些好的表演者。她拒绝了她认为不够好的表演者。但最后，当她真的遇到一个很有才华的人时，她和 Zari 却觉得这个人太出色了，可能会让她们自己的表演显得更差——于是她们决定选那个哑剧表演。

### Polished

In the story, Lily and Zari are choosing performers for their school’s talent show. Lily **keeps rejecting** everyone because she’s worried that **boring acts will make the audience leave** before their band performs. Then, when two talented girls perform an amazing song, Lily **admits** they’re really good—maybe even better than their band. Zari then refuses to accept them, afraid that such a great act will make their own performance look worse. In the end, they decide to accept **the juggling mime** instead, just so their band won’t be **outshined**.

故事中，Lily 和 Zari 正在为学校的才艺秀挑选表演者。Lily 一开始把所有人都拒绝了，因为她担心如果节目太无聊，观众会在她们乐队表演之前就离场。后来，当两个女孩演奏了一首很棒的摇滚歌曲时，Lily 承认她们可能比自己的乐队还厉害。于是 Zari 拒绝录取这组表演者，因为她担心观众拿来和她们的演出比较，会显得她们逊色。最后，为了不被比下去，她们反而选择了那个表演杂耍的哑剧演员。

## Sentences

- 一个耍杂技的哑剧演员？哑剧演员不应该有道具的。
  - A juggling mime? Mimes aren't supposed to have props.
- We'll be the only **ones** performing.
  - 为什么是 **ones** 而不是 **one**？
  - 因为主语是复数：“we”
    - **We** 指的是说话人和 Lily（至少两个人），是复数。
    - 所以要说 **the only ones**（唯一的一群人）
    - 如果你只说 **the only one**, 就成了 “唯一的一个人”，和复数主语不一致。
