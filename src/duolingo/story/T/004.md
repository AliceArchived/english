# Terrible Date

Lin arrives at her friend Bea's house.

- **Lin**: Hi, Bea! Are you ready to go?
- **Bea**: No! I can't find my phone!
- **Lin**: Where was the last place you used it?
- **Bea**: During my date last night … Uh oh.
- **Lin**: What?
- **Bea**: It was a terrible date. I really liked the guy, but I broke his favorite lamp!
- **Lin**: Oh no!
- **Bea**: And then I **spilled** red wine on his new white couch!
  - I felt so bad! I told him that I was going to the bathroom, but I climbed out the window instead.
  - I think I left my phone at his apartment.
- **Lin**: You didn't even say goodbye?
- **Bea**: No …
- **Lin**: So, where does he live?
- **Bea**: On ~~the~~ east side of the town, next to the old bank.
  - **"On the east side of town"** _(“the” is often dropped in natural English here)_
- **Lin**: Let's go!

Bea goes to an apartment and knocks on the door. A man answers.

- **Man**: You're back! I thought you didn't like me when you climbed out the window.
- **Bea**: Uh … I do, but … Do you have my phone?
- **Man**: Yes, here!

He gives Bea her phone.

- **Bea**: So, can we have dinner again sometime?
- **Man**: Yes … But not at my apartment.
