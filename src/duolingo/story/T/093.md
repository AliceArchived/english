# Time for a Change

Lin brings a big blue chair into Lucy's apartment.

- **Lin**: Look at the new chair I found **for** the living room!
- **Lucy**: I can't believe you actually paid money for that!
  - How much did it cost?
- **Lin**: It was free! I found it outside, in front of the blue house.
  - I think the woman who lived there died … but it's a free chair!
- **Lucy**: You aren't going to keep it in our living room, are you?
- **Lin**: I knew you were going to hate it.
- **Lucy**: It won't look nice **with** our curtains…
  - But I suppose we can buy new curtains.
- **Lin**: Hey! I like our curtains…
- **Lucy**: But if we buy new **curtains**, then we'll need to buy new pillows too…
- **Lin**: I like the pillows we have now …
- **Lucy**: Ooh! Now I'm going to buy new **lamps** too!
  - This room is going to be beautiful!
- **Lin**: I like how the room looks now.
- **Lucy**: Too bad! I'm going to change the room now! I'm excited!
- **Lin**: We're going to have to buy all new things …
- **Lucy**: That's OK, the chair was free … remember?

## Sentences

- "Look at the new chair I found for the living room!"
  - This is fine, but you could slightly improve clarity:
    - → **"Look at the new chair I found _for our_ living room!"** _(Adds context and warmth)_
- "Too bad! I'm going to change the room now! I'm excited!"
  - Consider merging for smoother flow:
  - → **"Too bad — I'm changing the room, and I'm excited!"**
    _(Combines energy and intent in one punchy line)_
