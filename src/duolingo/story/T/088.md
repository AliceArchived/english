- **Bea**: Eddy, you have to pay it.
- **Eddy**: I know, but I have a date tonight. I don't have time!

- **Bea**: Don't worry. I have a solution.
- **Eddy**: Really? You're the best, Bea!

- **Eddy**: Oh, wow! That's perfect. Tell me more!
- **Bea**: It's at a quiet place. You'll finish quickly and still have time for your date.
- **Eddy**: Amazing! Where do I go?
- **Bea**: Here's the address.
