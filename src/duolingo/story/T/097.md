# Trampoline Flights - B3

Junior is bouncing on the **trampoline** in the yard when Eddy comes outside.

- **Eddy**: What are you up to, Junior?
- **Junior**: Dad, I started a new business!
- **Eddy**: Oh no… What is it this time?
- **Junior**: I'm a flight attendant.
- **Eddy**: A flight attendant?
- **Junior**: Yeah, I give neighborhood kids "flights" on the trampoline! Only 2 dollars each!
- **Eddy**: Un… How does that work?
- **Junior**: I say, "Welcome **aboard**, fasten your seatbelts!" Then they jump.
- **Eddy**: Do you serve snacks?
- **Junior**: Snacks? No, Dad. Snacks cost extra.

Eddy looks over and notices some kids sitting on the trampoline looking bored.

- **Eddy**: Junior, what's going on? They're not jumping.
- **Junior**: Oh… I said "fasten your seatbelts," but I forgot to give them **pretend ones**.
- **Eddy**: And no snacks?
- **Junior**: Nope. Snacks were "carry-on" only.
- **Eddy**: Junior, you can't run a flight without snacks… or seatbelts!

Eddy disappears into the garage and comes back with chairs, blankets, and a speaker.

Soon, the yard looks like an airplane.

- **Eddy**: OK, kids, come in! Take your seats, and I'll "fasten" your seatbelts.
- **Junior**: Wow, Dad, this is awesome!

Eddy serves popcorn to the kids while airplane sounds play from the speaker.

Later that night, Junior talks to Eddy.

- **Junior**: I'll admit it, Dad. You made my flights first-class!
- **Eddy**: Thanks, but next time you **take over** snacks. OK?
- **Junior**: Sure. I'll charge them three dollars extra!

**Why weren't the kids jumping?**

The children weren’t jumping because Junior had forgotten to hand out the pretend seatbelts, which were an essential part of their **imaginative play**. Without them, the kids probably didn’t feel it was safe or realistic enough to continue their “trampoline flight” adventure. This small detail shows how seriously they took the game, relying on every element to make the experience feel real. It’s interesting how even imaginary scenarios require structure and rules to keep the fun going.

孩子们之所以没有跳，是因为 Junior 忘了发放他们游戏中必不可少的假装安全带。没有这些安全带，孩子们可能觉得继续他们的“蹦床飞行”冒险既不安全也不真实。这个小细节体现了他们对游戏的认真态度，他们依靠每一个元素来增强沉浸感。有趣的是，即使是想象中的场景，也需要一定的规则和结构来维持乐趣。
