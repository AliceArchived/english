# The Great Baking Show

Vikram and his friend, Lin, are at a TV studio. They are having an **audition** for a new baking show.

- **Vikram**: Thanks for being my assistant today, Lin.
- **Lin**: No problem! I know how important this is to you. And I brought some extra ingredients to help us win.
- **Vikram**: What?! If we want to succeed, we need to follow my recipe exactly.
- **Lin**: Trust me, I watch a lot of baking shows. If you want to win, you have to do something special!

The producer **makes an announcement**.

- **Producer**: You have one hour to bake your cakes. Go!
- **Vikram**: Please follow my recipe, Lin! Just add the flour and sugar...

Lin adds the flour and sugar — and some small pieces of cheese.

- **Vikram**: No!
- **Lin**: Cheese will make this cake much more interesting.
- **Vikram**: I don't want an interesting cake!
- **Lin**: And I added **beet juice**. It's bright red!
- **Vikram**: Lin!
- **Producer**: Bakers! It's time to put your cakes in the oven.
- **Vikram**: Maybe it will be OK ...

While the cake bakes, Lin puts a scarf around Vikram's neck.

- **Lin**: If you want to be on TV, then you need to look cool.
- **Vikram**: We need to pay attention to the cake. I don't want it to burn ... Oh no!

Vikram takes the cake out of the oven. It's on fire.

- **Lin**: Use the scarf!

Vikram uses the scarf to stop the fire. The scarf catches on fire **as** the producers laugh.

- **Vikram**: Oh no, they're laughing at us. We should just go.

Vikram gets ready to leave, but the producer stops him.

- **Producer**: Don't go! We want you to be on our show!
- **Lin**: Really?
- **Vikram**: But we burned our cake ...
- **Producer**: Yes, but you and Lin are so fun to watch!

## Speaking

### Do you think Vikram likes working with Lin? Why or why not?

I think Vikram doesn't like working with Lin. As an assistant, Lin has too many ideas, and she **does** things without permission. If she really wants to try some ideas, she should try then before the audition, **check if** these ideas **work** well, and then talks to Vikram.

> Corrections:

1. “I think Vikram doesn't like working with Lin.” → 正确但可以更自然地表达为：
   - “I **don’t think** Vikram **enjoys** working with Lin.”
2. “**she does things without permission**” → 正确，但可以更正式地表达为：
   - **“she often acts without asking”** 或
   - **“she takes action without consulting him.”**
3. “**she should try then before the audition**” → 有两个错误：
   - “then” 应为 **“them”**（指代 ideas）
   - 缺少连接词，应为 “she should try them **out** before the audition”
4. “**check if these ideas work well, and then talks**” → 动词时态不一致，应为 **“talk”**（与前句结构一致）

I **don't think** Vikram **enjoys** working with Lin. As an assistant, Lin has too many ideas, and she often **acts without asking**. If she really wants to try some ideas, she should **try them out** before the audition, **check if** these ideas **work** well, and then **talk** to Vikram.

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0–7.5

I don’t think Vikram enjoys working with Lin. As his assistant, she seems to have too many ideas and often acts without his permission. If she really wants to try something new, she should test her ideas before the audition, check whether they work well, and then discuss them with Vikram. That would show more respect and **professionalism**.

我认为 Vikram 并不喜欢和 Lin 合作。作为他的助理，Lin 想法太多，而且经常未经允许就擅自行动。如果她真的想尝试新点子，应该在试镜前先测试一下这些想法，看是否有效，然后再和 Vikram 沟通。那样会显得更有尊重，也更专业。
