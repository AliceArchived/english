# The Gym Date - B3

Bea walks into the gym where Eddy is nervously trying his sneakers.

- **Bea**: All right, Eddy, today is your big blind gym date! I made a workout **itinerary** for you. It's inspiring and will make you look great.
- **Eddy**: Itinerary? Bea, I don't know…
- **Bea**: Trust me, Eddy. You want to impress her, right?
- **Eddy**: I guess so… Yeah.

Bea hands Eddy a piece of paper with a detailed list.

- **Bea**: First, you'll start on the treadmill. Run fast but controlled. Then, we'll move to weights. Show strength, but don't overdo it. Got it?
- **Eddy**: What if I mess up?
- **Bea**: You won't. Just follow the plan!

Eddy steps onto the treadmill, looking nervous.

The blind date walks by and waves. Eddy waves back, loses focus, and **trips**! He falls off the treadmill with a loud **thud**.

- **Eddy**: Ow! I ruined it!

Bea rushes over, hiding a laugh.

- **Bea**: Are you okay, Eddy?
- **Eddy**: No. I messed up. She probably thinks I'm a failure.

Bea helps Eddy stand up.

- **Bea**: Eddy, listen. You don't need to be perfect. Just be yourself.
- **Eddy**: Really?
- **Bea**: Yes! Someone who's worth your time will laugh with you, even when you fall.

Eddy smiles and looks at the blind date. She's laughing, **waving him over**.

- **Eddy**: Oh… Maybe you're right.
- **Bea**: Go get 'em, tiger!
- **Eddy**: Thanks, Coach!

</audio>

Bea **reassured** Eddy by saying he doesn’t need to be perfect — **real connections** aren't built on flawless appearances but on shared moments, even awkward ones. She reminded him that someone truly worth his time will appreciate him as he is and laugh with him, not at him, when things go wrong. It was her way of showing that **authenticity** matters far more than **perfection**, especially in relationships.

Bea 安慰 Eddy，说他不需要完美——真正的联系不是建立在无懈可击的外表上，而是建立在共同的时刻，哪怕是尴尬时刻上。她提醒他，真正值得他珍惜的人会接受真实的他，并在他出糗时与他一起笑，而不是嘲笑他。这也是她表达“在关系中，真实远比完美重要”的一种方式。
