# The Letter

Zari and Lily walk past a bookstore.

- **Zari**: Let's go inside! I love old books.
- **Lily**: That's why we're friends.

The girls go inside the bookstore.

Zari picks up a book and opens it.

- **Zari**: Lily! There's an old letter inside this book.
- **Lily**: What does it say?
- **Zari**: A man named Joseph is writing to his friend, Gabriela.
  - He wants her advice.
- **Lily**: Why?
- **Zari**: He says he loves two women, Katherine and Meg.
  - Katherine is really intelligent.
  - But Meg is really funny.
  - He doesn't know who to marry!
- **Lily**: I hope he stayed single.
- **Zari**: Who did his friend Gabriela tell him to marry? I need to know!

The owner of the bookstore comes to talk to the girls.

- **Gabriela**: Oh, that's a wonderful book!
  - It belonged to my husband. He died last year.
- **Zari**: Oh, I'm sorry.
  - Was your husband's name Joseph?
- **Gabriela**: Yes!
- **Zari**: Wow! Is your name Katherine or Meg?
- **Gabriela**: My name is Gabriela.
