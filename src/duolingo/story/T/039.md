# The Flu Shot

Eddy and his son Junior are waiting in a small room at the doctor's office.

- **Junior**: I wish I didn't have to get a flu shot...
- **Eddy**: I know! You must be scared, son.
  - But this shot will keep you healthy!
- **Junior**: Will the shot hurt?
- **Eddy**: It might hurt for a second, so you have to be very brave!
- **Junior**: But I don't know how to be brave!
- **Eddy**: Just think about the **warrior** in your video game. He's not afraid of anything, right?
- **Junior**: That's right. He fights dragons!
- **Eddy**: Exactly!
- **Junior**: OK. I'm going to be brave. I'm not going to scream or cry.

There is a knock on the door. It's the doctor.

- **Doctor**: Hello, Junior! Are you ready for your shot?
- **Junior**: Uh... I think so.

The doctor opens the drawer and takes out a needle.

- **Junior**: Oh no, Dad, the needle is so big!
- **Eddy**: Oh. Wow, you're right. That needle is very big.
- **Junior**: Doctor, I don't think I can do this!
- **Doctor**: OK, Junior... I'll give your dad a flu shot first, so you can see it's very safe.
- **Eddy**: What? I'm getting a flu shot?
- **Doctor**: Why not?
- **Eddy**: Because this appointment is for Junior, not for me.
- **Doctor**: You should get a flu shot too.
- **Junior**: What's wrong, Dad? You don't look very good.
- **Eddy**: That needle is very big!
- **Junior**: Dad, this shot will help you stay healthy. We have to be very brave, remember?
- **Eddy**: Yes... Yes, I remember...

The doctor gives Eddy his flu shot.

- **Eddy**: Ow!

The doctor puts the needle away.

- **Doctor**: I'm finished! That was a good plan, Junior.
- **Eddy**: What plan? Junior, I don't understand.
- **Junior**: Well, Dad, the doctor and I just convinced you to get your flu shot!

## Writing

### What is your favorite part of the story? Why?

I loved the humor in this story. Eddy **thought** only his son needed to get a flu shot and **tried** to **convince** Junior to get a shot, but actually **he** himself was the target.

I loved the part when Eddy himself was about to get a flu **shot** and then he found **out** that the needle was so big. That was quite a different feeling compared with before, when he thought only Junior needed to get a shot.

> Corrections

1. 原句语法基本正确，但部分表达略显重复或不够自然；
   - 如 “he himself was the target”
     - → 更清晰写成 “became the target”；
   - “That was quite a different feeling compared with before”
     - → 可更自然表达为 “It was completely different from how he felt earlier”。

### Polished

I loved the humor in this story. Eddy thought only his son needed to get a flu shot and tried to convince Junior to be brave, but in the end, he himself became the target.

I especially loved the part when Eddy was about to get the shot and found out that the needle was so big. It was completely different from how he felt earlier, when he believed only Junior would be getting the shot.
