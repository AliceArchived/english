# The Great Blackout - B2

Our Town Weekly

'Remembering the Worst Blackout in Our Town's History'

By Jennifer Mendoza

Five years ago, the city experienced its longest blackout in history.

We are reflecting on the Great Blackout by publishing residents' experiences of the event.

- **Eddy**: I'd just put my son to bed when the lights went out.
  - I was ... I mean, he was terrified!

— recalled longtime resident Eddy, who then went to a neighbor for help.

- **Eddy**: I brought my son to the house of the smartest person I know, my best friend.
  - I knocked extra hard so he'd know it was urgent, but he never answered.

As the blackout continued, some residents, like Oscar, hid.

- **Oscar**: As soon as the lights went out, there was chaos.
  - Eddy **was banging on** my door and screaming my name!
  - That's when I decided to stay under my bed until sunrise.

— Oscar said with a **haunted** look in his eyes.

While there are still questions about the cause of the blackout, newly discovered security videos show a woman dressed in black entering the power plant right before the electricity went out.

The mysterious woman looks a lot like a local resident named Lucy.

When asked to comment, Lucy refused, but her granddaughter Lin offered:

- **Lin**: We all know my grandma used to be a spy.
  - She was obviously on a mission at the power plant.
  - But the blackout only lasted seven minutes, so why is everyone making it a big deal?

## Writing

### What would you do during a blackout?

I probably just **stayed** at home. Actually, **blackouts happened** from time to time when I was a kid. We just lit candles, **continued doing** whatever we **were doing**, or went to bed early.

> Corrections:

1. “I probably just **stayed** at home.”
   - → 句子用的是过去时，但整个问题是在问假设性的 “What would you do”，应使用虚拟语气或一般将来/现在时，例如 “I’d probably just stay at home.”
2. “**blackouts happened** from time to time”
   - → 没有语法错误，但上下文更自然的是用过去进行描述，如 “used to happen from time to time”
3. “**continued doing whatever we were doing**”
   - → 正确，但可以稍作润色使逻辑更清晰

**I’d** probably just **stay** at home. Actually, **when I was a kid**, blackouts **used to happen** from time to time. We **would** light candles, keep doing whatever we were doing, or just go to bed early.

我可能就会待在家里。其实小时候偶尔会停电，我们会点蜡烛，继续做手头的事，或者早早上床睡觉。

We **would** light candles...

在讲述过去某种**反复发生的行为或习惯**时，英语中有两种常见方式：

| 结构                   | 用法说明                                                                  | 示例                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **used to + 动词原形** | 表示过去经常做，现在不做了                                                | I used to ride my bike to school.       |
| **would + 动词原形**   | 表示过去在某个情境下**反复发生的动作**，但不能用于状态动词（如 be, like） | Every summer, we would go to the beach. |

这里的 would 是在回忆童年停电时经常做的事情，意思是：

“每次停电时，我们都会点蜡烛……”，表示一种过去的固定模式。

| 表达                             | 说明                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **We would light candles…** ✅   | ✔ 更有“习惯感”“每次都是这样”的感觉   |
| **We used to light candles…** ✅ | ✔ 也对，强调“过去经常做，现在不做了” |

两者都对，但 **“would”** 在这里更贴近那种“每次停电我们都会……”的情境重复性。

注意：would 不能用于表示过去的状态
例如：

- ✖ We ~~would be~~ kids. → ❌（不对）
- ✅ We **were** kids. 或 We used to be kids.

“We would light candles.” 并不是“我们会点蜡烛”（虚拟语气），而是“我们过去每次都点蜡烛”（一种固定做法）。

## Sentences

- 我们通过发表居民对这次事件的经历来回顾大停电。
