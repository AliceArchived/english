# The Art Show

Oscar waits in a long line for an art show downtown.

He **walks over** to the security guard.

- **Oscar**: I've been waiting in line since seven o'clock! Can I go in now?
- **Security**: Sir, this is a very famous artist. You need to wait.

Oscar continues to wait. Then the security guard waves at a man in a leather jacket. He lets the man inside the building.

- **Oscar**: Hey! I was here before that man!
- **Security**: Yeah. But he's cool. Look at what he's wearing.

Oscar gets an idea. He runs into a store nearby and buys a new jacket. He **walks over** to the security guard again.

- **Oscar**: Now will you let me in?

The security guard looks at Oscar wearing his new jacket.

- **Security**: That's a great jacket. But no, you still can't go in.

The security guard lets a man and a woman go into the building.

- **Oscar**: Those people just got here!
- **Security**: It's cold. I didn't want them to wait outside for a long time.
- **Oscar**: I'm cold! I've been waiting outside for hours!
- **Security**: But now you have a warm jacket.
- **Oscar**: Ugh!
  - Will you let me inside if I give you ... this?

Oscar tries to give the security guard five dollars.

- **Security**: Five dollars? Are you joking?
  - Please go back to the end of the line.
- **Oscar**: Ugh, fine.

Oscar sees his friend Lucy and waves at her.

- **Oscar**: Hey, Lucy! You're here for the art show too?! I've been waiting in line for hours.
- **Lucy**: You have?
- **Oscar**: Yeah, but I'm giving up now. Let's go get dinner instead.
- **Lucy**: Sure. I'm really hungry after looking at all of that art.
- **Oscar**: What? You got inside?
- **Security**: Of course. She's very cool.

## Writing

### Would you wait in line for hours to see an art show? Why or why not?

> Correction

1. "I would not waiting"
   - → 错误，应为 “I would not wait”
2. “Then why should I spend so much time to something…”
   - → 应为 “on something”，介词错误
3. 最后一问句结构不太自然，可稍作调整使语气更清晰

I would not **wait** in line for such a long time just to see an art show. I'm not that interested in art and don’t really know how to appreciate it. So why should I **spend** so much time **on** something I don't understand?

我不会为了一个艺术展而排很长时间的队。我对艺术没那么感兴趣，也不太懂得欣赏它。那我为什么要在我不了解的东西上花那么多时间呢？

### Polished

No, I wouldn’t wait in line for hours just to see an art show. I’m **not really into art**, and to be honest, I don’t know much about how to appreciate it. If **I can’t truly enjoy** or **understand** it, then I **don’t see the point of** spending so much time on it.

> 亮点表达：

1. “I’m not really into art”
   - → 自然表达兴趣不足
2. “to be honest”
   - → 增加语气真实感
3. “I don’t see the point of…”
   - → 高分表达，比“why should I…”更成熟自然
4. 句式结构清晰，逻辑递进明确：
   - 不喜欢 → 不懂欣赏 → 不值得花时间

不，我不会为了看一个艺术展排几个小时的队。我对艺术真的不太感兴趣，说实话，我也不太懂得如何欣赏艺术。如果我不能真正享受或理解它，那我就觉得没必要花那么多时间了。

I would not wait in line for hours just because of an art show. First, I'm not so fond of art; Second, even if it's not an art show, I still don't want to wait **for** such **a** long time. The only situation I'll wait **for** is **something** I can't avoid, such as **going** to **the** government to do somethings.

> Correction

- **“First, I'm not so fond of art; Second,…”**
  - → 标点使用不一致，应该统一用句号或都用分号，并注意大小写。
  - 改为：
    - **First, I'm not so fond of art. Second, even if it's not an art show...**
- wait for such a long time”
  - 正确，但更自然说法是：
    - **wait in line for that long**
- The only situation I'll wait for is something I can't avoid…
  - 意思对，但结构可以更简洁自然。
    - “The only time I’d wait is when I really have no choice...”
- “going to the government to do somethings”
  - ❌ “somethings” 不正确，不能复数
  - 应为：
    - “to do something at a government office” 或
    - “handle government paperwork”

I wouldn’t wait in line for hours just to see an art show. First, I’m **not really into art**. Second, even if it **were** something else, I still wouldn’t want to wait in line **for that long.** The only time I’d do that is if I **had no choice**—like dealing with paperwork at a government office.

我不会为了看一场艺术展而排好几个小时的队。首先，我对艺术没有特别兴趣。其次，即使不是艺术展，我也不愿意等那么久。除非真的没办法，比如要去政府机构办理手续，我才会愿意等。

### Formal Writing

**Describe whether you would wait in line for hours to see an art show, and explain why or why not.**

To be honest, I wouldn’t wait in line for hours **just** to see an art show. It’s not that I dislike art — I do think it’s important and meaningful — but I’m **simply** not that **into** it myself. I’ve never studied art history or painting, and I don’t really know how to appreciate the **deeper meaning behind most artworks**.

If I had to wait for several hours **just to get inside**, I would **probably** get bored or impatient. For me, time is **precious**, and I would rather spend those hours doing something I’m more **passionate about**, like watching a film, going for a walk, or even just reading a good book.

Also, I think **part of the value of** art comes from being able to **connect with** it **emotionally**. Since I don’t have much background knowledge or **personal connection** to most kinds of **visual art**, I often find myself just walking past paintings without truly understanding or feeling anything.

So overall, **while** I respect people who love art and are willing to wait for it, I personally wouldn’t **go through** all that trouble. I think it really depends on your interests — and for me, I’d rather skip the line and spend my time elsewhere.

说实话，我不会为了看一个艺术展排好几个小时的队。这不是因为我讨厌艺术，我确实认为它有价值也很有意义，但我自己并不是特别感兴趣。我也没学过艺术史或绘画，也不太懂怎么欣赏艺术作品背后的深意。

如果我必须等几个小时才能进去，我可能会觉得无聊或不耐烦。对我来说，时间很宝贵，我宁愿把这些时间用来做我更感兴趣的事情，比如看电影、散步，或者读一本好书。

另外，我觉得艺术的一部分价值在于你能不能和它产生情感共鸣。因为我对大多数视觉艺术没有太多背景知识或个人连接，所以我常常只是路过那些画作，并不能真正理解或感受到什么。

总的来说，虽然我尊重那些喜欢艺术并愿意等候的人，但我个人不会为此大费周章。我觉得这很取决于兴趣所在——对我来说，我宁愿把时间花在别的地方。

## Sentences

- walks over
  - You used it twice. It's fine and natural in casual narrative, but you could vary it slightly if desired:
    - 1st use: “He **walks over** to the security guard.”
    - 2nd use: “He **approaches** the security guard again.” ← optional rewording for variety.
