# That's Not Dinner

Vikram runs into his neighbor's apartment.

- **Vikram**: Eddy, I'm here! What's the emergency?!
- **Eddy**: I have a date, but I forgot she is a vegetarian... like you!
- **Vikram**: That is not an emergency!
- **Eddy**: But I really like her!
- **Vikram**: OK, I'll help you.
  - A vegetarian dinner is easy to make!

Vikram opens the refrigerator.

- **Vikram**: Hmm... your refrigerator is full of meat.
  - Chicken, beef, pork ... Why do you have so much meat?!
- **Eddy**: Because I exercise a lot! I need to eat meat for my muscles!
- **Vikram**: Do you have anything else?
- **Eddy**: Yogurt!
- **Vikram**: Eddy, yogurt is not dinner.
- **Eddy**: I also have ... cereal?
- **Vikram**: Eddy, cereal is not dinner! Where are all the vegetables?
- **Eddy**: Did you look in the back of the refrigerator?
- **Vikram**: Oh! I see something green!
- **Eddy**: Actually, I think that's Junior's science experiment.
- **Vikram**: You should go to the supermarket.
- **Eddy**: She'll be here in thirty minutes!
  - I don't have time to go to the supermarket!

Junior walks into the kitchen.

- **Junior**: Hi, Vikram. Hi, Dad.
  - What's wrong?
- **Vikram**: He's worried because his date is a vegetarian.
- **Junior**: So?
- **Eddy**: We don't have any food to make a vegetarian dinner!
- **Junior**: That's not true. We have ice cream.
- **Vikram**: Junior, that's not dinner.
- **Junior**: Yes, it is! Dad and I eat ice cream for dinner all the time!

## Sentences

1. **"but I forgot she is a vegetarian"**
   - → **"but I forgot she’s a vegetarian"** _(Contracted form fits more naturally in spoken dialogue)_
   - Or: **"but I forgot she was a vegetarian"** _(Since the context is past – you forgot)_
2. **"Why do you have so much meat?!"**
   - → This is grammatically fine, but if you want smoother emphasis:
     **"Why do you have _this_ much meat?!"** (Optional, for extra surprise effect)
