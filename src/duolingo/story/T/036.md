# The Frog

Junior sees his classmate, Betsy, hiding a frog in their teacher's desk.

- **Junior**: Betsy, what are you doing?
- **Betsy**: I'm going to scare our teacher.
  - He'll love it! It will be a funny **prank**.
- **Junior**: I love pranks! I didn't realize you love them too.
- **Betsy**: Don't tell him, OK?
- **Junior**: Don't worry. I won't.

Later, their teacher sits down at his desk.

When he opens his drawer, the frog jumps out.

- **Teacher**: Ahhhhh!

All of the kids in the class laugh.

The frog jumps onto Betsy's desk, and Junior catches it.

- **Teacher**: This is not funny! Everyone, **sit** down!

No one sit**s** down.

- **Teacher**: Who did this? Who put this frog inside my desk?!

The class **becomes** very quiet.

- **Teacher**: Class, if no one tells me, then I will have to punish the whole class.

Junior raises his hand and looks at Betsy.

- **Junior**: I'll tell you who did it.

Everyone looks at Junior. Betsy looks worried.

- **Betsy**: Junior! Please, don't…
- **Junior**: I put the frog inside your desk.

Junior smiles **at** Betsy.

- **Junior**: I love frogs. Don't you?

Junior picks up the frog and kisses it.

- **Teacher**: Junior, you're **in a lot of trouble**! I'm going to call your dad right now.
- **Junior**: I don't mind.

The teacher leaves the classroom.

- **Betsy**: Thanks, Junior. That was very brave. You know, you're pretty cool!
- **Junior**: No problem! So… do you maybe want to be my girlfriend?
- **Betsy**: Ew! No. You kissed a frog.

**In this story, Betsy tells Junior that he is very brave. Describe the personality of someone in your family or of a friend.**

My uncle isn't exactly a brave person — in fact, he's quite the opposite. Outwardly, he comes across as agreeable and tends to go along with whatever others say. But when it comes to family matters, he always wants to take control.

The main issue is that he avoids taking real responsibility. If something goes wrong, he rarely reflects on his own actions and instead blames others. Although he likes the idea of being in charge, he struggles to deal with the pressure and consequences that come with leadership.

我的叔叔并不是一个特别勇敢的人 —— 事实上，他正好相反。在外人面前，他表现得很随和，常常附和别人的观点。但在家庭中，他总是想掌控一切。

问题在于，他经常逃避真正的责任。如果事情出了问题，他很少反省自己的行为，反而倾向于责怪别人。虽然他喜欢当领导的感觉，但他却难以应对随之而来的压力和后果。

#### 1. Describing a Supportive Friend

My best friend is incredibly supportive. No matter what challenges I'm facing, she’s always there to listen without judgment and offer thoughtful advice. She's the kind of person who genuinely celebrates others’ successes and never hesitates to help when someone is struggling.

我最好的朋友非常支持我。无论我面临什么困难，她总是毫无评判地倾听，并提供贴心的建议。她是那种会真心为别人成功而高兴的人，也从不犹豫在别人遇到困难时伸出援手。

#### 2. Describing a Hardworking Family Member

My older sister is one of the most hardworking people I know. She always **sets high goals** for herself and **puts in a lot of effort** to achieve them. Even when she fails, she doesn't give up — instead, she learns from her mistakes and tries again. Her **perseverance** really inspires me.

我姐姐是我认识的人中最勤奋的之一。她总是为自己设定很高的目标，并努力去实现它们。即使失败了，她也不会放弃——而是从错误中吸取教训，再次尝试。她的坚持不懈真的很激励我。

- perseverance: 英 /ˌpɜːsəˈvɪərəns/, 美 /ˌpɜːrsəˈvɪrəns/
  - n. 坚持不懈；不屈不挠

#### 3. Describing a Positive and Cheerful Person

My cousin has a really cheerful personality. She’s always smiling and somehow manages to stay positive even when things don’t go as planned. Being around her just makes people feel relaxed and happy — she has a way of **lifting everyone’s mood**.

我表姐的性格非常开朗。她总是笑容满面，即使事情不顺利也能保持积极的态度。和她在一起让人感到轻松愉快——她总能让大家心情变好。

#### 4. Describing a Reliable Person

My father is someone I deeply admire because he’s so reliable. If he says he’s going to do something, you can **count o**n him to **follow through**. People trust him because he always keeps his word and handles situations with calm and logic.

我非常敬佩我父亲，因为他非常可靠。如果他说要做一件事，你就可以放心他一定会完成。他总是言出必行，处理事情时也非常冷静和理性，因此很值得信赖。

### Practice History

**Why does Junior say he put the frog in the desk?**

This question is in the **present tense** (“does Junior say”), but it’s asking about what Junior said — and what he said was a statement about a **past action** ("he **put** the frog in the desk").

Junior says/ to protect/ punish the class

> Corrections:

1. "he wants to" → should be "he **wanted** to" for past tense consistency.
2. "Actually, Betsy does the prank" → incorrect tense; should be "Betsy **did** the prank."
3. "which makes the teacher so angry to threat to punish" → awkward phrasing; better: “which **made** the teacher so angry **that** he threatened to punish…”
4. The flow of ideas is slightly clumsy; clarity and cohesion can be improved.

Junior **says** he put the frog in the teacher’s desk because he **wanted** to protect Betsy. Actually, **it was** Betsy **who** **played** the prank, **which** made the teacher so angry **that** she threatened to punish the whole class.

**In this story, Betsy tells Junior that he is very brave. Describe the personality of someone in your family or of a friend.**

My uncle isn't brave. Actually, he is the opposite. **On the** outside, he listens **to** what everybody says and easily **believes them**; but in the family he wants to **be** in charge. **However**, he can't take responsibility. And if things go wrong, he always **blames** other people.

> Corrections:

1. “On the outside” → 更自然的表达是 “On the surface” 或 “Outwardly”
2. “he listens to what everybody says and easily believes them” → “them” 指代不清，可优化为 “believes whatever people say”
3. “he wants to be in charge” → 语法正确，但可配合语境加强表达
4. “However” 开头没问题，但语气连接稍显突兀，可用 “The problem is,” 或 “The issue is,” 更自然
5. 语气整体较负面，可稍作润色以避免显得过于刻薄，增强表达的平衡性和逻辑性

My uncle isn't very brave — in fact, he's quite the opposite. **Outwardly**, he **seems** to agree with whatever people say and **tends** to believe them easily. But **within the family**, he always **wants** to be the one in control.

The issue is, he often **avoids** taking real responsibility. When things go wrong, instead of **reflecting on his own actions**, he **tends** to blame others. He prefers being in charge, but he struggles to handle the consequences that come with leadership.

我叔叔不是很有勇气——事实上，恰恰相反。在外人面前，他总是随声附和，轻易相信别人说的话。但在家里，他总是想掌控一切。

问题在于，他常常不愿意承担真正的责任。一旦事情出错，他往往不会反思自己，而是责怪他人。他喜欢主导，但却难以承担当领导应有的后果。

- “Outwardly” and “within the family” are both clear, but the contrast could be tightened with more natural connectors like “However” or “On the surface…”

My uncle isn't very brave — in fact, he's quite the opposite. On the surface, he appears agreeable and tends to accept whatever others say without question. However, within the family, he often insists on being in control.

The problem is, he frequently avoids taking true responsibility. When something goes wrong, instead of **reflecting** on his own behavior, he tends to **shift the blame** to others. He likes **being in charge**, but he has difficulty dealing with the consequences that leadership brings.
