# The Broken AC

The school air conditioner breaks on a very hot day. Oscar and Eddy are in one of the classrooms after school.

- **Oscar**: It's **sweltering** in here! The air conditioner is off, and I can't take this heat anymore.
- **Eddy**: Yeah, it's hot! But this is great for sweating. It's like free exercise!
- **Oscar**: Eddy, not everything is about exercise! I'm melting. How can you just sit there smiling?
- **Eddy**: Positive thinking, Oscar! Plus, look! I brought soda! Want one?
- **Oscar**: No, thanks. I'd rather not drink anything from a can you pulled out of your bag.

Oscar fans himself with a stack of papers and looks at the tall cupboards on the wall.

- **Oscar**: The windows up there could bring in some fresh air.
- **Eddy**: Those windows? But they're really high.
- **Oscar**: Watch and learn, Eddy.

Oscar drags a chair over to the cupboard, climbs onto it, and **pulls** himself **onto** the tall cupboard.

- **Eddy**: Whoa, careful! You're standing on a cupboard. It doesn't look very strong!
- **Oscar**: I can handle this! I'm very light, thank you very much.

Oscar reaches for the window but loses his balance.

- **Oscar**: AHHH!

Oscar falls to the floor and **grabs** his wrist.

- **Eddy**: Oh no! Are you OK?
- **Oscar**: Do I look OK? My wrist! I think it's **sprained**.
- **Eddy**: Don't worry, I'll drive you to the doctor. Let's go!
- **Oscar**: Perfect… now I get to spend more time with you.
- **Eddy**: See? This day is getting better already!

空调坏了

- **Oscar**：这儿太**闷热**了！空调没开，我再也受不了了。
- **Eddy**：是啊，好热啊！但这很适合出汗，就像免费的锻炼！

- **Eddy**：积极思考，Oscar！而且你看！我带了汽水！要一罐吗？

- **Oscar**：上面的窗户也许能带进点新鲜空气。

**Why did Oscar climb onto the cupboard?**

Oscar climbed onto the cupboard because he was trying to reach the window and get some fresh air. The classroom had become **uncomfortably hot** due to the **broken air conditioner**, and opening the window seemed like the only way **to cool things down**. I can understand why he did it — sometimes, when it’s too hot to focus or breathe properly, people will do whatever they can to feel better. His action was a bit extreme, but totally **relatable**.

Oscar 爬上橱柜是为了够到窗户，想透透气。教室里因为空调坏了变得特别闷热，打开窗户似乎是唯一能降温的办法。我能理解他为什么那么做——有时候天气太热，根本无法专注或呼吸顺畅，人就会想尽办法让自己舒服一点。他的做法虽然有些极端，但完全可以理解。

- relatable: 英 /rɪˈleɪtəb(ə)l/, 美 /rɪˈleɪtəb(ə)l/
  - adj. 有关系的，可关联的；能引起共鸣的；使人觉得自己能理解某人

Helpful Phrase: Oscar climbed/ to reach/ fresh air

Oscar climbed onto the cupboard to reach the window ~~to~~ get some fresh air. It's too hot in the classroom since the air conditioning ~~is~~ broken.

> Corrections:

1. Changed “to reach the window to get some fresh air” → “to reach the window **and** get some fresh air” for smoother coordination.
2. Shifted “It's too hot” → past tense “It was too hot” to match the narrative tense.
3. “since the air conditioning is broken” → corrected to past tense “was broken” for consistency.
