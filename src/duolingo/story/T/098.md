# Themed Hiking Journey - B3

Bea is standing in the park with a clipboard in her hand. Eddy **approaches**, holding a soccer ball.

- **Eddy**: What are you doing?
- **Bea**: I've started a new career! I'm a hiking guide now.
- **Eddy**: Oh, cool! So, like… you walk with people?
- **Bea**: No, Eddy! It's not just walking. I create themed journeys.

Bea shows him **a laminated map** with drawings of dragons, castles, and **treasure chests**.

- **Eddy**: Whoa, this looks… complicated.
- **Bea**: It's not complicated! It's fun! There are six stops: the "King's Bridge," "Magic Pond," and "Queen's Viewpoint."
- **Eddy**: Uh… do people have to fight dragons too?
- **Bea**: Very funny, Eddy. You just don't understand art.

Bea starts leading a small group of hikers, explaining every stop in great detail. The hikers look tired and bored.

Meanwhile, Eddy and his son, Junior, walk into the same park for **a casual stroll**.

- **Eddy**: Look, Junior! A frog! And there's a stream!

One by one, other people see Eddy talking and join his group. They laugh and enjoy his **laid-back approach**.

Bea returns to the park entrance and sees Eddy surrounded by happy hikers.

- **Bea**: What are you doing?
- **Eddy**: Just walking and showing people cool stuff!
- **Bea**: No maps? No themes? No… dragons?
- **Eddy**: Nope. Just frogs and laughs. **Turns out**, people like easy journeys.
- **Bea**: I planned so much. They went on your walk?!
- **Eddy**: Don't worry, Bea. You can join us next time!
- **Bea**: Ugh. I'll bring the **laminated** map.

主题徒步之旅

Bea 手里拿着一个写字板，站在公园里。Eddy 拿着一个足球走了过来。

- **Eddy**：你在干什么？
- **Bea**：我开始了新职业！我现在是一名徒步向导。
- **Eddy**：哦，酷！所以就是……你和别人一起走路？
- **Bea**：不，Eddy！这不只是走路。我会设计主题之旅。

Bea 给他看了一张覆膜的地图，上面有龙、城堡和**宝箱**的绘图。

- **Eddy**：哇，这看起来……很复杂。
- **Bea**：一点也不复杂！很有趣！一共有六个停靠点：“国王桥”、“魔法池塘”和“王后观景台”。
- **Eddy**：呃……人们还需要打龙吗？
- **Bea**：真有趣，Eddy。你就是不懂艺术。

Bea 开始带领一小群徒步者，详细地介绍每一站。徒步者看起来疲惫又无聊。

与此同时，Eddy 和他的儿子 Junior 走进同一个公园，进行**随意的散步**。

- **Eddy**：看啊，Junior！一只青蛙！还有一条小溪！

其他人一个接一个地看到 Eddy 在讲话，也加入了他的队伍。他们笑着，享受他**轻松随意的方式**。

Bea 回到公园入口，看到 Eddy 被一群快乐的徒步者包围着。

- **Bea**：你在干什么？
- **Eddy**：只是走走路，给大家看看有趣的东西！
- **Bea**：没有地图？没有主题？没有……龙？
- **Eddy**：没有。只有青蛙和笑声。结果，人们更喜欢轻松的旅程。
- **Bea**：我计划了那么多。他们竟然去参加你的徒步了？！
- **Eddy**：别担心，Bea。下次你也可以加入我们！
- **Bea**：呃。我会带上那张**覆膜**地图。
