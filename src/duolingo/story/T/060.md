# The New Counselor - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

Our school announced we have a new healthcare counselor. She's helping students with check-ups and blood pressure checks. Everyone thinks she's amazing and wants to talk to her about their health. She provides information on staying healthy and is available all week.

I hate it. I don't want someone new asking about my health or trying to be helpful. It seems like everyone is going to the counselor now, and it's making me anxious. I prefer to be left alone, not told what I should or shouldn't do to stay healthy.

The counselor replaced my favorite part of the library with her office. The quiet corner where I read is now filled with health posters and brochures. My alone time is gone, and I have to find somewhere else to hide and read my books.

Plus, now students are talking about health stuff nonstop. Someone mentioned blood pressure in art class, and I nearly fell asleep because it was boring. This counselor is making health the new trend, and I don't want to participate.

Our school needs to rethink the new healthcare counselor. I don't need health advice or check-ups. I need a quiet place to read and some peace.

## Vocabulary

- counselor: 英 /ˈkaʊnsələ/, 美 /'kaʊnslɚ/
  - n. 顾问，参事
    - (协助学生解决问题的)指导老师
    - <律>律师
    - (使馆等的)参赞；法律顾问
    - (儿童夏令营)管理员

## Style

1. **"healthcare counselor"** → **"health care counselor"**
   1. _"Health care"_ is typically used as two words when referring to the profession or role (e.g., _health care provider_). _"Healthcare"_ as one word is more often used as an adjective (e.g., _healthcare system_).
2. **"check-ups"** → **"checkups"**
   1. In modern usage, _"checkup"_ is more commonly one word unless used in very formal or older texts.
3. **"She's helping students with check-ups and blood pressure checks."** → **"She helps students with checkups and blood pressure checks."**
   1. Use of present simple "helps" is more stylistically consistent with the tone and time frame of the other present tense sentences.
4. **"Everyone thinks she's amazing and wants to talk to her about their health."** → **"Everyone thinks she's amazing and want to talk to her about their health."**
   1. _"Everyone"_ is singular, but when referring to "_everyone… their health_", the verb agreement with "_wants_" is correct. So this line is actually **correct as is**, despite appearing awkward.
5. **"Our school needs to rethink the new healthcare counselor."** → **"Our school needs to rethink having a new health care counselor."**
   1. You don’t “rethink a person” — you rethink a decision or policy. Slight rephrasing improves clarity.

## Sentences

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**How do you feel about Lily's opinion on health?**

I respectfully disagree with Lily’s view on health. I **strongly believe** that our health is **closely connected to** the habits we **form**, and high school **plays a key role** in **shaping** those habits. It’s during these formative years that students start to take more responsibility for their lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, and sleep. Ignoring this stage could lead to poor habits that are difficult to change later in life. So, I believe Lily’s opinion underestimates the importance of habit-building in **adolescence**.

我并不认同 Lily 对健康的看法。我坚信我们的健康与所养成的习惯密切相关，而高中阶段在塑造这些习惯方面起着关键作用。在这个形成性阶段，学生开始对自己的生活方式负责，比如饮食、锻炼和睡眠。如果忽视这一阶段，可能会导致形成难以改变的不良习惯。因此，我认为 Lily 的观点低估了青春期培养习惯的重要性。

### Practice History

**How do you feel about Lily's opinion on health?**

I think/ In my opinion/ Lily's opinion

I don't think Lily's opinion is a good one. In my opinion, good health **is** related **to** our habits, and high school is an essential time to build good **habits** for everyone.

> Corrections:

1. "is related to" is grammatically correct, but adding "closely" strengthens the logical connection in a more natural, academic tone.
2. “build good habits” is not wrong, but “**develop good habits**” is more formal and appropriate for IELTS speaking/writing.

I don't think Lily's opinion is a good one. In my opinion, good health **is closely related to** our habits, and high school is an essential time for everyone to **develop** good habits.

我认为 Lily 的观点不太好。在我看来，良好的健康与我们的习惯密切相关，而高中是每个人培养好习惯的重要时期。
