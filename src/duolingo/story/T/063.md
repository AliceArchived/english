# The Pie Festival

Lucy and Vikram are at the pie festival. They each made a pie for a contest.

They see Lin at the judge's table.

- **Lucy**: Lin, I can't wait for you to taste my strawberry pie. Then you can tell everyone that it is the best.
- **Vikram**: No, my apple pie is the best!
- **Lin**: I'll taste both pies and decide!
- **Vikram**: Try mine first. I've been working on my recipes for years. I'm the best baker in town.
- **Lucy**: You're wrong! Everyone knows that grandmothers make the best pies.

Lin tries a slice of Vikram's pie.

- **Lin**: Wow … you're right. It's perfect.
- **Lucy**: Now try mine!

Lin eats a slice of Lucy's pie.

- **Lin**: Yours is also great, Grandma! It's sweet but not too sweet!
- **Vikram**: But which pie do you prefer?!
- **Lin**: Hmm… I think I need to have another slice.
  - I'm really hungry. I stayed up all night watching TV, and I forgot to eat!

Lin continues eating.

- **Vikram**: So … who is the winner?
- **Lucy**: I let you live in my apartment for free, remember?
- **Vikram**: But I always give you free cookies!
- **Lin**: It's really hard to decide…

Suddenly, Oscar runs to the judge's table.

- **Oscar**: Sorry I'm late! I'm ready to judge the pies.
- **Vikram**: Oscar, you're the judge?!
- **Oscar**: Of course I'm the judge! I have the best opinions!
- **Lucy**: Lin, I thought you were the judge!
- **Lin**: I never said that.
- **Vikram**: But you were standing at the judge's table!
- **Lin**: I was just here to charge my phone! Then you asked me to taste your pies!
- **Oscar**: So where are Lucy and Vikram's pies?
- **Lin**: Sorry, I finished both of them.
