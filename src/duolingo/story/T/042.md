# The Gallery Mishap - B3

Lucy and Oscar arrive at a private gallery opening showcasing avant-garde sculptures. Oscar looks around, unimpressed.

- **Oscar**: Lucy, these sculptures are… confusing. Where is the art?
- **Lucy**: Oscar, it's avant-garde. You're supposed to feel confused; it inspires mystery.
- **Oscar**: Mystery? No, it inspires headaches.
- **Lucy**: Stop complaining. Perhaps you'll meet someone interesting.

Oscar sighs but continues looking around. He sees a large sculpture made of glass and metal.

- **Oscar**: I could make something better in my sleep.
- **Lucy**: Careful, Oscar. Don't touch anything. These pieces are expensive.

Oscar waves his hand dramatically to emphasize his point.

- **Oscar**: Trust me, Lucy. Real art —

His hand accidentally hits the sculpture. It wobbles and crashes onto the floor.

- **Oscar**: Oh no! That wasn't on purpose!
- **Lucy**: Great. That's unacceptable, Oscar. You've 'improved' the art, now.

Just as Lucy finishes speaking, the artist rushes over.

Instead of being angry, the artist claps.

The artist calls Oscar a genius and declares the fallen sculpture a new masterpiece.

- **Oscar**: Wait, what?
- **Lucy**: I told you, Oscar. Mystery inspires art, even your mistakes.

The artist announces Oscar as their new partner for future projects.

- **Oscar**: Well, Lucy, it seems I've succeeded without even trying!
- **Lucy**: Don't let it go to your head, partner.
