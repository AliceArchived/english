# Tea and a Chance - B3

Lucy and Lin stop by a small neighborhood café on their walk.

- **Lin**: This place looks boring, Grandma. Can we leave?
- **Lucy**: Boring? No, no. This is the best café in the neighborhood.
- **Lin**: Really? I don't believe it. Let's just find a place with sandwiches.
- **Lucy**: Lin, wait. Let's stay for tea. It's peaceful here.
- **Lin**: Tea? I don't want tea. I want a sandwich.
- **Lucy**: Fine. But did you see the **barista** over there?

Lin glances at the counter.

- **Lin**: Yeah, I see her. So what?
- **Lucy**: She's cute. Don't you think?
- **Lin**: I guess.
- **Lucy**: Lin, this is your chance. Sit down. Relax. **Flirt** with her.
- **Lin**: What? No, Grandma. Why would I do that?
- **Lucy**: Because she's cute. And because she keeps looking over here.

Lin sits down, a little confused.

- **Lin**: I don't think she's looking at me.
- **Lucy**: Oh, she is. I can tell.
- **Lin**: Are you sure?
- **Lucy**: I always know these things.

Lin looks toward the counter again.

- **Lin**: Fine. One tea. But only for five minutes.
- **Lucy**: Of course, Lin. Five minutes.

Lucy turns to hide her smile.

- **Lucy**: By the way, do you still want a sandwich later?
- **Lin**: Yes. Why?
- **Lucy**: Well, I heard about a new sandwich shop…
- **Lin**: You mean we didn't have to stop here?!
- **Lucy**: Oh, Lin, don't be so serious. Tea first, sandwiches later!

## Hint

This story, **“Tea and a Chance,”** is a lighthearted, slightly humorous scene with a hidden theme: **seizing small opportunities for connection, even when you don’t feel ready or interested**.

Here’s what it’s really about:

- **On the surface**: Lin doesn’t want to stop for tea and insists on getting a sandwich. Lucy insists they stay, but not just for the tea — she nudges Lin to talk to the cute barista.
- **Underneath**: Lucy, the grandmother, is gently pushing Lin to be open to new experiences — in this case, maybe flirting, taking a small romantic risk, or just getting out of their comfort zone.
- **Twist**: At the end, it’s revealed Lucy had an ulterior motive — she _knew_ there was a sandwich place and could’ve taken Lin there, but she chose this café instead. That hints she had planned the moment as a kind of gentle matchmaking or confidence-boosting nudge.

So while it may seem weird or random at first, the core message is:

> **Sometimes people who care about us push us to pause, notice others, and take a small emotional risk — like talking to someone new.**

The weirdness adds to the charm — a grandma encouraging flirting over tea is unusual, but memorable.

---

Lucy wanted to stay at the café because she hoped to encourage Lin to talk to the barista on her own. From the way **the story unfolds**, it’s clear that Lucy saw an opportunity for Lin to take initiative and possibly start a connection with someone she liked. Instead of pushing her directly, Lucy stepped back in a subtle way — staying behind gave Lin the space and confidence to approach the barista without feeling pressured. I think Lucy was being thoughtful and supportive by creating the right moment for her friend.

Lucy 想留在咖啡馆，是因为她希望鼓励 Lin 自己去和咖啡师说话。从故事发展的方式来看，Lucy 显然是察觉到了 Lin 的心思，希望她能够主动迈出第一步，或许还能建立某种联系。Lucy 并没有直接施压，而是用一种很巧妙的方式选择退后一步 — 留下来，给了 Lin 一个可以放松、鼓起勇气开口的空间。我觉得 Lucy 这个做法很体贴，也很支持朋友，是在帮她创造一个合适的机会。
