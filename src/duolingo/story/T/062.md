# The New Oven

Vikram arrives at his bakery and sees his employee Lin cleaning an old, **rusty** oven. She smiles proudly when she sees Vikram.

- **Vikram**: What's this? You were supposed to buy a new oven to replace the one you broke yesterday. This is a used oven.
- **Lin**: It's used, but it still works! And it was $500 cheaper than a new oven.
  - We can use the money I saved to buy a TV. Then I can watch movies at work.
- **Vikram**: But it smells awful!
- **Lin**: I'm still cleaning it. Trust me, this was a great deal.

Later that day, Lin is baking **cupcakes** in the kitchen when Vikram enters.

- **Vikram**: Lin, this oven is making the whole bakery smell like fish!
- **Lin**: It's not that bad.

Suddenly, a stray cat jumps onto the counter.

- **Vikram**: The smell is **attracting** **stray cats**!
- **Lin**: They just like the smell of your delicious cupcakes.

Five more cats enter the kitchen.

- **Lin**: Actually, this is great. We can finally start a cat cafe!
  - We'll make even more money **in addition to** the $500 I already saved.
- **Vikram**: Lin, we're not starting a cat cafe. Please just clean the oven again. I'll get the cats out of here.
- **Lin**: Fine.

As Vikram tries to catch the cats, Lin **sprays** **air freshener** into the oven.

- **Vikram**: Be careful. The oven is still on!

Suddenly, a fire starts inside the oven.

- **Vikram**: Oh no!

Vikram rushes to get the **fire extinguisher** and quickly puts out the fire.

Later, Lin and Vikram watch as a repairman **inspects** the oven.

- **Man**: The fire damaged the inside of the oven, and it needs a new door.
- **Vikram**: Can you fix it?
- **Man**: Of course. It will cost $1000.
- **Lin**: It's a good thing I saved us that $500!

## Speaking

Do you think Lin really saved Vikram some money? Why or why not?

### 🌟 IELTS Band 7–8 level

No, I don’t think Lin actually saved any money in the end. When she **bought** the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was damaged after she cleaned it. **Fixing** it will cost $1000. **Even after subtracting** the $500 she **initially** saved, it still **ends up** costing $500 more than **just** buying a new oven **in the first place**.

不，我认为林最后其实没有省下任何钱。她买的旧烤箱虽然便宜了 500 美元，但在清洁过程中却损坏了。修理费用是 1000 美元。即使减去她省下的那 500 美元，整体花费也比一开始直接买个新烤箱还贵了 500 美元。

### Story

In the story, Lin purchases a used oven for the bakery, **claiming** it was $500 cheaper than a new one. However, the oven **emits** a strong **fishy** smell, attracting stray cats into the bakery. When Lin attempts to mask the **odor** with air freshener while the oven is still on, it **catches fire**. A repairman later informs them that fixing the oven will cost $1,000, **effectively negating any initial savings**.

Therefore, Lin's attempt to save money by buying a used oven ultimately results in higher expenses due to repair costs and the **complications** caused by the oven's condition.

故事中，Lin 为面包店买了一个二手烤箱，声称比新的便宜了 500 美元。然而，这个烤箱散发出强烈的鱼腥味，引来了流浪猫。当林试图在烤箱还开着时用空气清新剂掩盖气味时，烤箱起火了。维修工随后告诉他们，修理烤箱将花费 1000 美元，等于把最初节省的钱全赔进去了。

因此，Lin 为了省钱而购买二手烤箱的做法最终导致了更高的开销，因为除了维修费用外，还要应对烤箱状况带来的各种麻烦。

#### Effectively negating

The phrase "effectively negating" means "in practice, canceling out" or "making something meaningless or useless."

“Effectively negating” = 实际上等于把……抵消了 / 把……白费了

> effectively negating any initial savings
> = 实际上把最初节省的开支全抵消了
> = 等于一开始省的钱都白省了

#### complications

The word "complications" refers to **unexpected problems or difficulties** that make a situation more complex or harder to deal with.

- complications = 并发的问题 / 额外的麻烦 / 复杂情况
- In this context:
  - complications = 烤箱状态引起的额外问题，比如味道难闻、吸引流浪猫、引发火灾等

> complications caused by the oven's condition
> = 由于烤箱状况引发的额外问题

### Practice History

**Do you think Lin really saved Vikram some money? Why or why not?**

No, I don't think Lin actually saved any money ~~at last~~.at last. When she buying the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was broken when she cleaned it. And to fix it, it will cost $1000, minus the lower price, the total cost is $500 more than buying a new oven directly.

No, I don't think Lin actually saved any money **in the end**. When she **was** buying the old oven, it was $500 cheaper, but the oven was broken when she cleaned it. And to fix it, it will cost $1000, minus the lower price, the total cost is $500 more than **buying** a new oven directly.

> Corrections:

1. “minus the lower price”
   - → unclear and awkward; better as “even after subtracting the $500 she saved”
2. “more than buying a new oven directly”
   - → understandable but a little awkward. More natural: “more than just buying a new oven in the first place.”
