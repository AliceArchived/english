# Too Much Stuff

Lin comes home. Her grandmother Lucy's belongings are all over the living room.

- **Lin**: What's going on? This place is really messy.
- **Lucy**: Sorry, my cousin Mae is coming to visit. You know how she's so **neat** and **organized**...
- **Lin**: And she thinks you have too much stuff.
- **Lucy**: I know! I want to impress her by getting rid of some stuff.
- **Lin**: OK, let me help.
- **Lucy**: Lin, you're the **messiest** person I know!
- **Lin**: But I just watched a documentary about an organization expert. I know what I'm talking about.
  - First, you have to organize your belongings...
- **Lucy**: That's obvious, and I already did that.

Lucy points to three piles of stuff.

- **Lucy**: That pile is stuff that I want to keep.
  - That pile is stuff that I don't want to throw out.
  - And that pile is stuff that I love.
- **Lin**: But you're not throwing away anything! You're doing it wrong.

Several hours later, Lin and Lucy have finished reorganizing Lucy's belongings.

Lin proudly points at the piles.

- **Lin**: These are items that you use every day.
  - These items bring you happiness.
  - These items are important to you.
- **Lucy**: And we found one thing to throw out...
- **Lin**: Yes! This ugly goat sculpture!
- **Lucy**: That's fine. I don't even know where it came from.

Lin puts the goat sculpture in the trash.

The doorbell rings. It's Lucy's cousin, Mae. Lucy invites her in.

- **Mae**: Wow, the place looks so much neater than the last time I visited.
- **Lucy**: I'm so glad you like it!
- **Mae**: But where's that gorgeous goat sculpture I gave you?

## Sentences

1. "These are items that you use every day.
   - Slightly smoother phrasing:
     - → "These are **the** items you use every day."
       _(More natural and fluid)_
2. "These items bring you happiness. / These items are important to you."
   - These are grammatically fine, but you could unify tone:
   - → "These are **the** items that bring you happiness."
   - → "These are **the** items that **matter most** to you." (optional)
