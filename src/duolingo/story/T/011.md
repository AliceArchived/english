# The Art Auction - B3

Lucy and Oscar are at **an exclusive art auction**. Paintings hang on every wall.

- **Oscar**: Lucy, thank you for bringing me. I'll show these people I know real art!
- **Lucy**: Please don't cause trouble, Oscar. Just enjoy yourself.
- **Oscar**: Trouble? Me? Never!

The host requests everyone's attention for the next item — **a bright, abstract painting**.

- **Oscar**: That's fake!
- **Lucy**: Oscar, stop it.

Oscar steps closer to the front.

- **Oscar**: Excuse me, everyone! I doubt that painting is real. The colors are all wrong.

The crowd gasps. Lucy **hides her face with her hand**.

- **Lucy**: Oscar, you've got to calm down!
- **Oscar**: No, Lucy. I'm protecting art!

The **curator** walks up, clearly upset.

- **Oscar**: You should have called me before putting this here. I could teach you what real art is!
- **Lucy**: Oscar, you're spoiling this evening.
- **Oscar**: Me? I've just saved it!

Later, as they leave, Lucy shakes her head.

- **Lucy**: You just can't help yourself, can you?

Oscar's phone rings. He answers it.

- **Oscar**: Hello? Yes, this is Oscar. What? You want me to **authenticate** paintings? For money?

Oscar hangs up, grinning.

- **Oscar**: Lucy, they've requested my advice! I told you — I'm amazing!
- **Lucy**: And very loud.

艺术拍卖会

Lucy 和 Oscar 正在参加一场独家的艺术拍卖会。画作挂满了每一面墙。

- **Oscar**：Lucy，谢谢你带我来。我会让这些人看看我懂真正的艺术！
- **Lucy**：Oscar，请不要惹麻烦。好好享受就行了。
- **Oscar**：麻烦？我？从不！

主持人请大家注意接下来的拍品——一幅色彩鲜艳的抽象画。

- **Oscar**：那是假的！
- **Lucy**：Oscar，住手。

Oscar 走向前方。

- **Oscar**：各位，不好意思！我怀疑那幅画不是真的。颜色全错了。

人群倒吸一口气。Lucy 用手捂住了脸。

- **Lucy**：Oscar，你得冷静点！
- **Oscar**：不，Lucy。我是在保护艺术！

**策展人**走了过来，显然很生气。

- **Oscar**：你在把它放到这里之前应该叫我来。我可以教你什么是真正的艺术！
- **Lucy**：Oscar，你在破坏今晚的气氛。
- **Oscar**：我？我刚刚拯救了它！

稍后，他们离开时，Lucy 摇了摇头。

- **Lucy**：你就是管不住自己，对吧？

Oscar 的手机响了，他接起电话。

- **Oscar**：喂？是的，我是 Oscar。什么？你想让我**鉴定**画作？还有报酬？

Oscar 挂断电话，笑了起来。

- **Oscar**：Lucy，他们要我的意见！我早说过——我很厉害！
- **Lucy**：而且声音很大。

## Sentences

## Speaking & Writing

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why did the crowd gasp at the auction?**

The crowd suddenly gasped when Oscar **boldly** declared that the painting being sold at the auction was actually a fake. People were shocked, whispering to each other and glancing around to see if anyone else had noticed the **flaws**. Oscar’s confident tone made the atmosphere tense, and the **auctioneer** froze for a moment. It was a dramatic turn that no one had expected during what was supposed to be an exciting sale.

当 Oscar 大胆宣称拍卖会上正在出售的那幅画其实是赝品时，人群突然倒吸一口气。人们震惊地低声议论，四处张望，看是否有人也注意到了这些瑕疵。Oscar 自信的语气让现场气氛变得紧张，拍卖师甚至愣住了一会儿。这本应是一次激动人心的拍卖，却突然出现了出人意料的戏剧性转折。

> Explanation:

This version uses richer vocabulary (“boldly declared,” “dramatic turn,” “confident tone”), adds **sensory** details, and expands the context, making it natural for conversational fluency and emotional impact, which is essential for IELTS Speaking Band 7+.

### 🌟 Writing Band 7.0+

**Why did the crowd gasp at the auction?**

The crowd **reacted** with **a collective gasp** when Oscar **asserted** that the painting presented at the auction was, in fact, a **forgery**. His statement disrupted the smooth progress of the bidding, causing participants to exchange uneasy glances and whisper in disbelief. The auctioneer hesitated, **momentarily** unsure of how to proceed, while several potential buyers began to reconsider their interest. This **revelation** introduced **a sense of suspicion and urgency** into the event, transforming what had been an atmosphere of excitement into one of **tension and uncertainty**. The incident demonstrated how a single claim can significantly alter **the dynamics of an auction**.

当 Oscar 断言拍卖会上展示的那幅画其实是赝品时，人群齐齐倒吸一口气。他的发言打断了原本顺畅的竞价进程，使参与者面露不安，低声议论，难以置信。拍卖师犹豫了片刻，不知该如何继续，而几位潜在买家开始重新考虑是否出价。这一揭露使现场原本的兴奋氛围转变为怀疑与紧张，也凸显出一句话便可显著改变拍卖会气氛的事实。

> Explanation:

It uses formal and precise vocabulary (“asserted,” “forgery,” “transforming”), clear cause-effect links, and varied sentence structures, all of which are hallmarks of Band 7+ academic writing. The logical progression from action → reaction → consequence shows strong coherence and cohesion.

Here, “**the dynamics of an auction**” means _the way an auction works in practice — the flow of actions, reactions, and interactions between the people involved, and how these elements change over time_.

In this context:

- **Dynamics** doesn’t just mean “rules” — it refers to the changing forces that shape the situation.
- In an auction, these forces include:
  - Bidding behaviour (who bids, when, and how much)
  - Emotions (excitement, tension, hesitation)
  - Competition (rival bidders trying to outbid each other)
  - Pace (how quickly bids are placed)
  - Confidence level (trust in the item’s authenticity, belief in its value)
- When Oscar claimed the painting was fake, it disrupted these forces — people stopped bidding, hesitated, or changed strategy — so the dynamics of the auction changed.

Chinese explanation:
“拍卖的动态”指的是拍卖过程中各种互动与变化的过程，而不仅仅是规则。它包含了出价的节奏、参与者的心理变化、竞争的激烈程度，以及现场气氛等。当奥斯卡说画是假的，这些互动和节奏都被打乱了。

### Practice History

**Why did the crowd gasp at the auction?**

Helpful Phrases: The crowd/ because/ fake

The crowd gasped because Oscar said the painting ~~on~~ the auction was fake.

> Corrections:

1. Changed “on the auction” to “at the auction” because “at” is the correct preposition for events.

The crowd gasped because Oscar said the painting **at** the auction was fake.

人群倒吸一口气，因为 Oscar 说拍卖会上的那幅画是假的。
