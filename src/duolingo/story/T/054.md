# The Matchmaker - B2

媒人 / 红娘

Lily and her friend Zari are sitting in **biology** class.

- **Zari**: I know we've attended the spring dance together every year, but since I asked Troy to go this year, you'll need a date too!
- **Lily**: No, thanks. I've never even wanted to go with you. I'll just stay home and watch season 12 of "**Blood Carnival**."
- **Zari**: In my favorite romance novel, the **protagonist** falls in love with her biology class partner! So I've **arranged for** Troy's friend **Devon** to be your partner today.
- **Lily**: Devon spilled milk on me when we were five, and I've never liked him since then.
- **Zari**: That's the **plot** of my second favorite romance novel! The main characters hate each other at the **beginning** of the book, but then they fall in love!
- **Lily**: Sounds boring.

Devon **walks up** to them.

- **Devon**: Hey, Lily, I made a **playlist** for you. It's all bands that yell a lot.
- **Zari**: That's so thoughtful! He knows you like bands that scream. Troy has never made me a playlist ...

Zari watches as Lily and **Devon** do their biology experiment.

- **Zari**: Devon's so sweet. Lily is so lucky!

The next day, Devon brings Lily a **bouquet** of dried flowers.

- **Devon**: Lily, I got you these because I know you love dead stuff.

Devon walks away.

- **Zari**: Aw! He knows you so well.
- **Lily**: So?
- **Zari**: Troy has never given me flowers — alive or dead! I didn't know Devon was so romantic.
- **Lily**: Do you want the flowers?
- **Zari**: Yes!

Zari nervously turns to Lily.

- **Zari**: In my third favorite romance novel, it's the best friend who dates the guy in the end ...
- **Lily**: You want to ask Devon to the dance instead of Troy, don't you?
- **Zari**: Is that OK?
- **Lily**: Yes. I'll get to watch "Blood Carnival" after all.

## Writing

### What happened in the story?

In the story, Zari **tries** to **convince** Lily to **go on a date with** Devon, a boy who likes her. But Zari also **has feelings** for him. **Since** Lily isn’t interested in Devon, Zari finally **asks for her permission** to **date him**—and Lily agrees.

> Corrections:

1. **“Zari have a good feeling with Devon”**
   - → 应为过去式：**“Zari had feelings for Devon”**（更地道）
2. **“who seemed to love Lily”**
   - → 更自然表达为：**“who seemed to like Lily”**（“love” 太强烈，不符合情节）
3. **“arrange Lily to date with Davon”**
   - → 应为：**“set Lily up with Devon”** 或 “tried to arrange a date between Lily and Devon”
4. **“date with Davon”**
   - → “date” 是及物动词，不需要 “with”

In the story, Zari **had feelings for** Devon, who seemed to like Lily. Zari tried to **set** Lily **up** with Devon, but Lily wasn’t interested in him. Finally, Zari asked for Lily’s permission to date Devon, and Lily agreed.

在故事中，Zari 喜欢 Devon，但 Devon 似乎喜欢 Lily。Zari 试图撮合 Lily 和 Devon，但 Lily 对 Devon 没兴趣。最后，Zari 征求了 Lily 的同意后，自己去和 Devon 约会了。

### Polished

In the story, Zari tries to **set** Lily **up with** Devon, her biology class partner, because she wants Lily to have a date for the spring dance. But Lily isn't interested in Devon—she still remembers when he spilled milk on her as a kid. **As** Devon **keeps trying to** impress Lily **with** things she likes, Zari slowly **realizes** she **has feelings for** him herself. In the end, she asks Lily for permission to ask Devon to the dance, and Lily happily agrees so she can stay home and watch her favorite show.

故事中，Zari 想撮合 Lily 和 Devon，因为她希望 Lily 也能在春季舞会上有个舞伴。但 Lily 对 Devon 并不感兴趣，还记得小时候他把牛奶洒到自己身上的事。虽然 Devon 一直在努力讨好 Lily，Zari 却逐渐意识到自己喜欢上了他。最后，她鼓起勇气征求 Lily 的同意去邀请 Devon，而 Lily 也很乐意答应，因为她终于可以在家看自己最喜欢的剧了。

### 'Protagonist' vs 'Main Character' vs 'Hero'

1. 🔹 **Protagonist**
   - **Definition**: The character who drives the main story forward.
   - **Focus**: Central to the conflict.
   - **Not always "good."**
   - **Example**:
     - _Macbeth_ in _Macbeth_ is the **protagonist**, but he’s not a hero.
     - _Walter White_ in _Breaking Bad_ is the protagonist — but he becomes a villain.
   - > Think: The story follows **them**. They make the biggest choices.
2. 🔹 **Main Character**
   - **Definition**: The most **important character** in terms of time, focus, or impact.
   - **Focus**: May or may not be the protagonist.
   - Can be **bystanders** or **narrators** too.
   - **Example**:
     - _Nick Carraway_ is the **main character** (and narrator) of _The Great Gatsby_,
       but **Gatsby** is the protagonist.
     - In _Sherlock Holmes_, **Watson** is the narrator and main character, but **Holmes** is the protagonist.
   - > Think: Who tells the story or has the most “screen time.”
3. 🔹 **Hero**
   - **Definition**: A character who is morally **good**, **brave**, or **inspiring**.
   - **Focus**: Value-based, not structure-based.
   - Not every hero is the protagonist.
   - **Example**:
     - In _Harry Potter_, **Harry** is all three: protagonist, main character, and hero.
     - In _Star Wars: Rogue One_, **Jyn Erso** is the protagonist and hero.
     - In _Death Note_, **Light Yagami** is the protagonist, but not a hero — he's more of an anti-hero or villain.
   - > Think: This term is about **morality** or **nobility**, not just role in the story.
