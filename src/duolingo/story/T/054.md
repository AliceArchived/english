# The New App

Lucy is exercising. Lin walks in the room with her cell phone.

- **Lin**: Grandma! Look, I have a new app on my phone!
- **Lucy**: You always have a new app on your phone.
- **Lin**: But this app tells you if you're healthy!
- **Lucy**: I already know I'm healthy.
- **Lin**: Question one: How many steps did you take today?
- **Lucy**: Ten thousand.
- **Lin**: Wow, really? I only took ... twenty-seven steps today.
  - Question two: Do you eat healthy food?
- **Lucy**: Yes, and I only eat dessert on special occasions.
- **Lin**: I always eat dessert...
  - Question three: How many glasses of water do you drink every day?
- **Lucy**: Nine!
  - I love water! I'm like a fish.
- **Lin**: Nine? I only drink two glasses of water every day...
  - Question four: How many hours do you sleep every night?
- **Lucy**: I usually sleep for ten hours. But if I go dancing, I only sleep for eight hours.
- **Lin**: Eight hours?
  - Question five: Do you feel stressed?
- **Lucy**: Only when my granddaughter asks too many questions!
- **Lin**: But Grandma, you're getting older!
- **Lucy**: Maybe you should take the test.
- **Lin**: Me? Why?
- **Lucy**: Because you don't sleep enough, you don't eat healthy food, and you don't drink enough water!
