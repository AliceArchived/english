# The Tea Set

**Lucy gives her granddaughter Lin a gift.**

- **Lin**: Wow, what's this? Did you get me the jacket I wanted?!
- **Lucy**: Just open the gift.

**Lin opens it.**

- **Lin**: Oh … it's … an old, dusty tea set.
- **Lucy**: This tea set belonged to my grandmother. I want you to have it.
- **Lin**: But she gave it to you. You should keep it.
- **Lucy**: It belongs to you now.
- **Lin**: But I might break it.
- **Lucy**: No, you won't. I trust you.
- **Lin**: But … it's so ugly!
- **Lucy**: I know, but my grandmother gave it to my mother on her wedding day.
  - Then, my mother gave it to me on my wedding day.
- **Lin**: Uh … But it's not my wedding day.
- **Lucy**: I know. But you'll probably never get married! You're too **indecisive**.
- **Lin**: What?
- **Lucy**: Do you want the tea set or not?
- **Lin**: Now I really don't want it.
  - Just give it to Oscar. He drinks tea and he likes old things!
- **Lucy**: Oh, good idea!

Later, Lucy gives Oscar the tea set.

- **Oscar**: Wow, thanks! It's so beautiful.

Suddenly, Lin runs in.

- **Lin**: Grandma, I changed my mind! I want the tea set!
- **Lucy**: Sorry, I just gave it to Oscar.
  - See, I told you, you're too indecisive.
- **Lin**: But I just researched it online, Grandma. It's worth a lot of money!
- **Lucy**: It is?
- **Oscar**: Too late! Lucy gave it to me.
- **Lin**: This is so unfair. That was my wedding gift!
- **Oscar**: Lin, if you ever get married, I'll give it to you.
- **Lucy**: Don't worry, that will never happen.
- **Oscar**: I know. Does anyone want tea?
