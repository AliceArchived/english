# The Art of Persuasion - B2

A Book Review by Junior

After reading the book "The Art of Persuasion: Get What You Want," I'm now certain that I can get what I want in any situation!

For example, last week, my dad wanted me to clean my room. I'd already planned to clean it because it was dirty — even for my standards.

**Thanks to** Chapter 2, **Never Do Something for Nothing**, I learned that I could clean my room and convince my dad to buy me pizza in return.

Then, a few days later, my babysitter Zari wanted me to go to bed.

However, I was about to defeat an army of zombies in my video game.

**With what I learned from** Chapter 10, You Can't Argue with Facts, I made up facts about how video games improve children's **reflexes**.

As a result, she let me stay up until 10 p.m. playing video games that night!

Without a doubt, my biggest victory was when I went to Vikram's bakery and ordered a cookie.

**I followed the advice** in Chapter 12, **Flatter** for Success, and **complimented** Vikram by saying it was the best cookie I'd ever eaten (even though I've had better). As a result, Vikram gave me another cookie for free!

Long story short: this book is clearly essential for anyone who has ever wanted anything!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**How did the narrator convince their dad to buy pizza?**

The narrator **cleaned up** his own messy room and used a strategy from the book — never do something for nothing — to convince his dad to buy him pizza as a reward for doing chores he should have done anyway.

叙述者打扫了自己弄乱的房间，并用了书上的一个策略——永远不要无偿做事，说服他爸爸因为做了本该做的家务而给他买披萨作为奖励。

### Clean vs Clean up

#### 1️⃣ Cleaned

General verb: means to make something clean — could mean wiping, scrubbing, tidying, depending on context.

Example: I cleaned the floor. → You mopped or wiped it clean.

#### 2️⃣ Cleaned up

More specific in this type of context: Emphasizes tidying, putting things in order, removing mess or clutter.

Often used when talking about cleaning a space that was messy or disorganized.

Example: I cleaned up my room. → Suggests the room was messy, and you made it neat.

#### 👉 Why “cleaned up” fits better here?

The narrator’s room was messy because of him → the action is about tidying that mess.

“Cleaned up” paints a clearer picture that he put things in order, not just wiped or polished.

It matches the casual, spoken style (especially for IELTS Speaking) and makes the description feel more natural.

#### ✅ Summary:

- Cleaned = general, could mean any kind of cleaning.
- Cleaned up = focuses on tidying and removing mess — more precise for this story’s situation.

### Practice History

**How did the narrator convince their dad to buy pizza?**

The narrator cleaned/ used what / buy pizza

The narrator cleaned his room which he made it messy himself and used the strategy what the book suggested — never do something for nothing, and persuaded his dad to buy pizza for doing the chores which he should do.

> Corrections:

1. “which he made it messy himself” → grammatically incorrect; should be “which he had made messy himself.”
2. “used the strategy what the book suggested” → should be “the strategy the book suggested.”
3. “for doing the chores which he should do” → smoother as “for doing the chores he was supposed to do anyway.”
4. Added em dash spacing as you prefer (with spaces before and after).

The narrator cleaned his room, which he **had made messy** himself, and used the strategy the book suggested — never do something for nothing — **to persuade** his dad to buy pizza **in return for** doing the chores he was supposed to do anyway.

叙述者打扫了自己弄乱的房间，并用了书上建议的策略——永远不要无偿做事，说服了他爸爸因为做了本该做的家务而给他买披萨。
