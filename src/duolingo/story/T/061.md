# The New Friend - B3

Zari is walking to the cafeteria when she spots Lily standing by the lockers, laughing with Max, a foreign exchange student.

- **Zari**: Lily, what are you doing?
- **Lily**: Talking to Max.
- **Zari**: You're laughing with him!
- **Lily**: Yeah, I know.

Zari looks worried.

- **Zari**: Wait, is Max your new best friend?
- **Lily**: What? No.
- **Zari**: But you never stand around talking to people. You like being alone.
- **Lily**: True.
- **Zari**: And Max is also sarcastic like you! Are you… are you replacing me?

Lily rolls her eyes and looks at Zari.

- **Lily**: No, Zari. Don't be dramatic.
- **Zari**: Then what were you laughing about?
- **Lily**: Oh, I was explaining something **dumb** that happened today.
- **Zari**: What happened?
- **Lily**: Remember when you accidentally set off the fire alarm in science class?
- **Zari**: That was an accident! I didn't know the button was that sensitive!
- **Lily**: Yeah, well, Max asked why the cafeteria closed early. So I told him about your "fire alarm experiment."
- **Zari**: You told him?! Lily! That's so embarrassing!
- **Lily**: Relax. He thought it was funny.

Zari frowns but then starts to laugh.

- **Zari**: Okay, maybe it's a little funny.
- **Lily**: A little? It's the highlight of my day.
- **Zari**: You're so mean.
- **Lily**: That's why you need me. Nobody makes fun of you as well as I do.
