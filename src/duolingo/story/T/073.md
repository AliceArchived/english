# The Refund

Lily is working at the clothing store.

- **Customer**: Excuse me, how much is this suit?
- **Lily**: Two hundred dollars. Do you want to try the suit on?
- **Customer**: No, I don't have time. Just take my money!

The man buys the suit. The next day, he returns to the store.

- **Customer**: Excuse me! I want a refund for this suit.
- **Lily**: Why? Is there a problem?
- **Customer**: This is not a black suit!
- **Lily**: You're right. That's a blue suit.
- **Customer**: I came here to buy a black suit.
- **Lily**: OK, so why did you buy a blue suit?
- **Customer**: Look at my family photo!

The man shows Lily his family photo.

- **Customer**: My wife is wearing a black dress in this photo. She told me to wear a black suit to match her dress!
- **Lily**: I'm sorry, dude. You can't return the suit if you **wore** it.
- **Customer**: I only wore the suit for an hour!
- **Lily**: Read the bottom of the receipt.

He reads the receipt.

- **Customer**: "No refunds if you wear the clothing."
  - But the suit didn't even fit me! It was so uncomfortable!
- **Lily**: Listen, I'm sorry. I can't give you a refund unless there was a problem. Like, if the suit was damaged —
- **Customer**: I can get a refund if the suit is damaged? Well, fine! Look!

He tears the sleeve off the suit.

- **Lily**: Dude! That's not cool.
- **Customer**: I want my two hundred dollars back!

The store manager **runs over** to the **cash register**.

- **Manager**: What is the problem?
  - Oh! Sir, your suit looks damaged. Would you like a refund?
- **Customer**: Yes, please! Thank you so much, ma'am.
- **Manager**: Lily, we will talk about this later.
- **Lily**: I hate this job.

#### What happened in this story? Tell us.

In this story, a man bought a suit, but it wasn't the color he had expected. He wanted to return it, but Lily, the store employee, told him that refunds were only possible if the item was damaged. So, **in a rather bold move**, the man tore the sleeve of the suit on purpose in order to qualify for a refund. It's a **humorous** example of someone **bending the rules** to get what they want.

在这个故事中，一位男士买了一套西装，但颜色不是他想要的。他想退货，但店员莉莉告诉他只有在商品损坏的情况下才可以退款。于是，这名男子大胆地撕破了西装的袖子，好让自己符合退款条件。这是一个幽默的例子，展示了人们如何“钻空子”以达成自己的目的。

#### In your opinion, who's right, Lily or the manager? Why?

In my opinion, both Lily and the manager have **valid points**. Lily followed the store's policy and didn't do anything wrong — she simply acted **within her responsibilities** as **a regular employee**. At the same time, I think the manager was also right to **step in**. Handling difficult customers often requires flexibility, and as someone with more authority, the manager has the ability to make exceptions when necessary. So while Lily **upheld** the rules, the manager showed good judgment in resolving the situation.

在我看来，Lily 和经理都有道理。Lily 遵守了商店的规定，没有做错任何事——她只是作为普通员工履行了自己的职责。同时，我认为经理介入也是对的。应对难缠顾客时往往需要一定的灵活性，而经理拥有更高的权限，可以在必要时做出例外处理。所以，Lily 坚守了规则，而经理则展现了良好的判断力来解决问题。

### In your opinion, who's right, Lily or the manager? Why?

I think Lily is right, she didn't do anything wrong. But the manager is also correct. Dealing with customers is not easy, Lily as a average employee, she doesn't have the permision to give a customer refund against store rules, but the manager can.

I think Lily is right, she didn't do anything wrong. But the manager is also correct. Dealing with customers is not easy. Lily, as **an** average employee, doesn't have **permission** to give a customer **a** refund against store rules, but the manager can.

> Corrections:

1. "permission"
   - → better replaced with **"authority"** in this context, since we're talking about official power within a role.
2. The rest is mostly fine, with slight punctuation and fluency improvements.
