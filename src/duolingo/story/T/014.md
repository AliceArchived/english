# The Art Competition - B2

Lily is participating in her school's art competition. She and another student, Gabriela, are hanging their paintings on the wall.

- **Gabriela**: With that painting, you'll definitely win the trip to Madrid, Lily.
- **Lily**: There's no way. You're going to win because your mother is a judge.
- **Gabriela**: Yeah, my mom made me **enter** this **competition**, but it's so frustrating. I don't even know how to paint. Just look at my painting!
- **Lily**: Is that a ... shark?
- **Gabriela**: It's supposed to be a horse.
- **Lily**: I don't even know why I'm here. I guess I thought it would be cool to go to the art program in Madrid.
- **Gabriela**: You deserve to win, Lily!
  - All you have to do is be friendly to the judges.
- **Lily**: Then I've lost already.
- **Gabriela**: Just smile!
- **Lily**: I know you're trying to help, but I don't think this will work.

When the judges arrive, Lily shakes a judge's hand.

- **Lily**: I like ... your hat.
- **Gabriela**: Wow, this is hard to watch.

Lily tries to smile at her art teacher, Oscar, who's also a judge.

- **Oscar**: Are you OK, Lily? You seem like you're in pain.
- **Gabriela**: Doesn't Lily have amazing artistic technique?!

A few of the judges nod in agreement.

After the judges finish looking at the paintings, Oscar walks up to the **podium** to **address the crowd**.

- **Oscar**: Before I announce the winner, I have more exciting news! I'll be teaching the summer art program in Madrid!
- **Lily**: Hmm ... Maybe it's a good thing I'm going to lose.
- **Oscar**: I can't wait to spend endless hours discussing every painting I've ever painted. How **thrilling** for this lucky student!
  - Anyway, the winner is Lily! Congratulations!
- **Lily**: Judges, I think you should reconsider. Did you see Gabriela's shark painting?

## Writing

### Would you like to go to Oscar's art program? Why or why not?

I would not like **to** go to Oscar's art program. Oscar seems **to** lack of patience and understanding **towards** other people. I don't think he is a good teacher, and the program is all about his own paintings, which means **discussing art** not **famous** and **not influential** in **the** art field.

> Correction:

1. I would not like to go to…
   - 语法正确，但更自然的说法是：
   - I wouldn’t **want** to go… 或
   - I **don’t think** I’d **enjoy going**…”
2. Oscar seems to lack of patience and understanding…
   - ❌ “lack of” 后面要接名词，不能直接接 “patience and understanding”
   - 改为：“Oscar seems to **lack patience and understanding**…”
3. towards other people
   - 虽然可以接受，但更常见搭配是：**“with other people”**
4. discussing art not famous and not influential…
   - ❌ 句式混乱，不符合英语习惯表达。
   - 可改为：“discussing art **that isn’t** well-known or influential in the art world”
5. in the art field
   - 虽然没错，但 “**art world**” 更自然地道。

I **wouldn’t want to** go to Oscar’s art program. He seems to **lack patience and understanding** with others, which makes me think he wouldn’t be a good teacher. Also, the program **focuses only on** his own paintings, which means we’d be **discussing** art that isn’t well-known or influential in **the art world**.

我不想去参加 Oscar 的艺术项目。他看起来对别人缺乏耐心和理解，我觉得他不会是一个好老师。而且这个项目只关注他自己的画作，也就是说我们讨论的艺术并不出名，也没有什么影响力。

> Polished according to story:

No, I wouldn’t want to go to Oscar’s art program. He seems more **focused on himself** than on the students. When he announced that the winner would **get to spend** hours **hearing** him talk about his own paintings, it didn’t sound like a fun or inspiring experience. I’d prefer a program **where students get to learn, explore, and share their own ideas**.

不，我不想去 Oscar 的艺术项目。他看起来更关注自己，而不是学生。当他说获胜者将花上好几个小时听他讲自己的画作时，这听起来一点都不有趣也不激励人。我更喜欢那种让学生学习、探索并分享自己创意的课程。
