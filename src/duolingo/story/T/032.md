# The Drummer

Lily and Zari are waiting in line outside a theater.

- **Zari**: Are you sure we can get into the concert?
- **Lily**: Yeah, I met the drummer at a record store.
  - I told him that I love his band, so he asked me to come tonight.
- **Zari**: The drummer invited you?! That is so cool!
- **Lily**: Yeah.
- **Zari**: And he is so cute!
- **Lily**: He is? I didn't notice.
- **Zari**: You're lying.
- **Lily**: He's a very good drummer.
  - And he writes a lot of songs for the band.
- **Zari**: You like him!
- **Lily**: Be quiet, Zari.
- **Zari**: He invited you to his concert, so he probably likes you too!
- **Lily**: No. Do you think so?
- **Zari**: Of course!

A security guard stops them.

- **Security**: You can't go in there!
- **Zari**: It's OK, we're friends with the drummer.
- **Security**: You're friends with the drummer? I don't think so.

The drummer walks over to Lily and Zari.

- **Drummer**: Hi, Lily!
- **Zari**: I told you we knew the drummer.
- **Drummer**: I'm so glad you're here!
- **Lily**: You are? I'm cool. I mean... that's cool.
- **Drummer**: And I'm really glad you **brought** your friend.
- **Zari**: Me too!
- **Drummer**: A lot of fans are coming to the concert tonight. We really need both of you to help sell our T-Shirts.
- **Zari**: Uh...
- **Lily**: What?
- **Zari**: You invited us to your concert because you want us to sell T-shirts?
- **Drummer**: Yeah! Thank you so much!
  - My girlfriend is **by** the T-shirt table.
  - She can tell you what to do.
- **Zari**: Your girlfriend?
- **Drummer**: Yeah! She's the really pretty girl, over there. Tell her I said you can have a free T-shirt!

## Writing

### In your opinion, what are Lily and Zari going to do? Will they leave, stay for the concert or sell T-shirts? Why?

I think they will leave. If I were them, I **would** leave. The drammer just cheated on Lily to come to the concert. If he really wanted Lily to help him, he should tell her at first. Also, the pay he offered was quite low and he didn't tell Lily before —it was so rude to ask people to work and only pay a T-shirt.

> Correction:

1. "drammer"
   - → should be **"drummer"** (spelling error).
2. "he should tell her at first"
   - → should be **"he should have told her at first"** to reflect past unreal conditional.
3. "he didn't tell Lily before"
   - → better phrased as **"he didn't tell Lily beforehand"** for clarity and correctness.

I think they will leave. If I were them, I **would** leave. The drummer just cheated on Lily to come to the concert. If he really wanted Lily to help him, he **should have told** her at first. Also, the pay he offered was quite low and he didn't tell Lily **beforehand** — it was so rude to ask people to work and only pay a T-shirt.

我认为她们会离开。如果我是她们，我也会离开。那个鼓手只是骗莉莉来参加演唱会。如果他真的想让莉莉帮忙，应该一开始就告诉她。而且他给的报酬太低了，还事先没有说明——让人干活却只给一件 T 恤，实在太无礼了。

### Polished

I think Lily and Zari will leave. The **drummer** didn’t invite them just to enjoy the concert — he wanted them to help sell T-shirts, and he didn’t even mention that beforehand. That’s very rude. On top of that, he has a girlfriend and still acted friendly toward Lily. If I were in their place, I would **feel used** and walk away.

我觉得莉莉和扎丽会离开。鼓手并不是单纯地邀请她们来看演唱会，而是想让她们帮忙卖 T 恤，而且事先也没说清楚，这很不礼貌。而且他还有女朋友，却还对莉莉表现得那么亲密。如果我是她们，我会觉得被利用了，然后选择离开。

## Sentences

- And I'm really glad you **brought** your friend.
  - This line is correct grammatically but might be smoother as:
  - And I'm really glad you **brought your friend along.** _(optional for natural tone)_
- My girlfriend is **by** the T-shirt table.
  - My girlfriend is **at** the T-shirt table.
  - “by” is not technically wrong, but “at the table” is more natural and common in this context.
