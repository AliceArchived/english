# The Rival - B2

At an art show, Oscar follows his friend Lucy reluctantly while she waves at her friends.

- **Oscar**: This gallery rejected my work! Why did you bring me here?
- **Lucy**: So you could meet other artists to inspire you.
- **Oscar**: Who could inspire me here? Every great artist needs a rival who pushes them to be better, but I'm the only great artist in this city.
- **Lucy**: Just enjoy the free food then.

Oscar walks to the **refreshments** table. A well-dressed woman approaches.

- **Oscar**: I wouldn't eat that cheese. It's terrible.
- **Woman**: A fellow cheese **connoisseur**! It's nice to meet someone else with good taste.
- **Oscar**: I'm Oscar. I'm an artist.
- **Woman**: I'm Kai. I'm an artist too. I can tell we'll be good friends.

Oscar looks around and shakes his head.

- **Oscar**: I really need to say something. This gallery… It's terrible.
- **Woman**: Why do you say that?
- **Oscar**: Not only is the cheese bad, but the paintings are **hideous**!
  - It looks like a **raccoon** painted them!

Oscar laughs loudly. Kai, however, is silent.

- **Woman**: A raccoon painted some of them. Our show **features** animals who were trained to be artists!
- **Oscar**: What do you mean by "our" show?
- **Woman**: I own this gallery.
- **Oscar**: Oh… Sorry…
  - But I can't believe you would show paintings made by animals instead of my work!
  - I could create a painting in one night that would be better than anything here!
- **Woman**: Well, don't submit it here, because I'd never display your work!

Kai throws her wine in Oscar's face and leaves. Lucy runs to Oscar.

- **Lucy**: Oscar, are you OK?

Oscar is quiet as he wipes the wine off his face.

- **Oscar**: I'm thrilled!
  - Every great artist has a rival, and now I do too. Coming here was a great idea!

## Vocabulary

## Sentences

- 有些画是浣熊画的。我们的展览展示了被训练成艺术家的动物！
  - A raccoon painted some of them. Our show **features** animals who were trained to be artists!
- Oscar walks to the refreshments table. A well-dressed woman approaches.
  - you should **still use “refreshments table”** even if there is only **one table**.

  - It's a **mass noun** (like “furniture” or “equipment”), and it's almost always plural in this context.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why did Kai throw wine at Oscar?**

Kai threw wine at Oscar because she **felt deeply insulted by** what he said — his words really hurt her feelings and made her lose her temper.

**Oscar has a new enemy! Do you have an enemy? How did that person become your enemy?**

Yes, I do have a few people I **would consider** enemies. In real life, **simply being kind** doesn't always **lead to** friendship. In fact, some people take advantage of your **kindness** and see it as a **weakness**. I've learned that with those kinds of people, you have to **set** clear **boundaries** and **stand your ground**. We should be kind, but only to those who treat us with respect. It's important to protect yourself while still being a good person.

是的，我确实有几个我认为是“敌人”的人。在现实生活中，光是待人友好并不一定能换来友谊。事实上，有些人会利用你的善良，把它当作软弱的表现。我逐渐明白，对于这种人必须划清界限、坚定立场。我们当然应该善良，但只对那些尊重我们的人。做个好人没错，但保护自己同样重要。

**Oscar has a new enemy! Do you have an enemy? How did that person become your enemy?**

Yes, I have enemies. In reality, it is not always **that** you act nice and people will become your friends. A lot of **times**, they just want to take advantage. For those people, just act strict **with** them. We can only be nice to people who respect us.

> Corrections:

1. “it is not always **that** you act nice and people will become your friends”
   - → awkward structure;
   - should be rephrased for clarity.
2. “A lot of **times**”
   - → grammatically okay, but more natural phrasing is
   - “A lot of **the time**” or “Often.”
3. “act strict **with** them”
   - → better phrased as
   - “**be** strict **with** them” or “act firmly toward them.”

Yes, I have enemies. In reality, just **being nice** doesn't always **mean** people will **become** your friends. A lot of **the time**, they just want to take advantage of you. **With** those people, **be strict**. We **should** only be kind to those who respect us.
