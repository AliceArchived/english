# Tiny Hat

Bea arrives at a fashion show wearing a new designer outfit.

Her guest, Lin, arrives wearing torn jeans and an old sweater.

- **Bea**: Lin! What are you wearing?
- **Lin**: What are you wearing? That's the smallest hat I've ever seen.
- **Bea**: Tiny hats are the new trend. I asked you to wear a cool outfit.
- **Lin**: This is my cool outfit.
- **Bea**: But your pants have holes in them! And you're wearing a sweater that I threw in the trash.
- **Lin**: Yeah, it's comfortable. Why do you even care what I'm wearing?
- **Bea**: Because you're my guest, and I came here to impress the fashion designer Mona Ma!
- **Lin**: That's why you're wearing a tiny hat?
- **Bea**: If I interview Mona Ma, it will really help my career!

A photographer approaches Bea and Lin.

- **Photographer**: Excuse me, can I take your photo?
- **Bea**: Oh... can we have our photos taken separately?

Bea steps away from Lin and the photographer takes a photo.

- **Lin**: So I'm not cool enough to be photographed with you?
- **Bea**: That's not it, Lin! You just don't understand fashion like I do.

Suddenly the fashion designer Mona Ma excitedly walks over to them.

- **Mona Ma**: Sorry to interrupt, but may I say something? You have the best outfit at this fashion show.
- **Bea**: Oh! Thank you—
- **Mona Ma**: Actually, I was talking to your friend. Where did you get those sandals?
- **Lin**: I found them outside my apartment building.
  - They were **sitting** next to a sign that said "free sandals."
- **Mona Ma**: Hahaha! You're **hilarious**! I must take a photo with you.
- **Lin**: Sure! Can my friend be in the photo too? She's my **stylist**.
- **Bea**: I am?
- **Lin**: Yes, you gave me this sweater.
