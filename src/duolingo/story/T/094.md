Eddy is eating something he found in the fridge.

- **Eddy**: Junior? This dessert tastes strange.
- **Junior**: What dessert?
- **Eddy**: The dessert that was in the fridge.
- **Junior**: That wasn't a dessert. That was my **science project**.
- **Eddy**: I thought it looked a little green …
  - How long was it in the fridge?
- **Junior**: Since November.
- **Eddy**: It's March now.
  - I feel sick.
- **Junior**: What's wrong?
- **Eddy**: I have a **stomachache** …
- **Junior**: Hmm. Does it hurt when I **poke** your stomach here?
- **Eddy**: No.
- **Junior**: What if I **poke** you here?
- **Eddy**: Ouch!
- **Junior**: Interesting …
  - How does your body feel?
- **Eddy**: My body feels cold … should I go to **the** hospital?
- **Junior**: Maybe. What else is wrong?
- **Eddy**: My mouth is dry. Now my mouth is wet. Now it's dry again!
  - Is my face blue?
- **Junior**: It is! Cool!
- **Eddy**: I think I'm dying. I'm going to lie down.
- **Junior**: Wait! I need to write this in my **notebook**!
- **Eddy**: Because you want to tell the doctor?
- **Junior**: No. Because I want to tell my teacher! You're my new science project!

## Sentences

- **"Because you want to tell the doctor?"**
  - → More natural phrasing:
    **"Is that so you can tell the doctor?"**
  - Or keep it: **"Because you want to tell the doctor?"** _(It works for informal tone.)_
