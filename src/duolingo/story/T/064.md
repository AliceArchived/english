# The Park Display - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

An art display opened in the park this week. It's free for the public. Many people are excited because it shows marvelous art by local artists. People say the art looks great.

I hate it. The park was my quiet place. I'd go there to be alone and away from the noise. But now, everyone is there to see the art. It's loud with all the people talking and clapping.

The art is everywhere, and it's impossible to avoid it. Sculptures and paintings are displayed in all the places I used to sit. I tried to find a quiet corner, but it's impossible. People are everywhere, explaining the art and taking photos.

Zari dragged me to the park to see the art display. She loved it and kept talking about the colors and styles. She wouldn't stop asking for my opinion. I missed when the park was just trees, bugs, and silence.

The park should go back to being a peaceful place. I don't need an art display to interrupt my quiet time. Art is great, but it doesn't belong everywhere. Let's keep the park just a park.

> Corrections:

1. “places” → “spaces” is more natural and contextually appropriate in the topic of public art.
2. “normal people” → “ordinary people” is more polite and idiomatic.
3. Missing article before “genius idea” → should be “a genius idea.”
