# The Party Helper - B3

Zari walks into the gym for the going-away party of Hannah, a girl at their school. She freezes when she sees Lily.

- **Zari**: Lily? What are you doing here? You hate parties!
- **Lily**: I know.

Lily is holding a box of decorations.

- **Zari**: Are you… helping with the party?
- **Lily**: Yeah.

Zari looks horrified.

- **Zari**: Why?! You always say Hannah is mean and annoying.
- **Lily**: She is.
- **Zari**: Then why are you helping her?
- **Lily**: I have a reason.

Zari gasps.

- **Zari**: Oh no. Are you moving away with her?! I can hardly believe it!
- **Lily**: What? Zari, no.
- **Zari**: Then why? Just tell me! Do you like her now? Are you **trying to fit in** with her friends?
- **Lily**: Zari, calm down.

Lily reaches into her bag and pulls out a DVD.

- **Lily**: Hanna borrowed my favorite horror movie weeks ago. If I don't help, I won't get it back before she moves.
- **Zari**: That's it?
- **Lily**: Yeah.

Zari shakes her head, then laughs.

- **Zari**: You could also download it, you know.
- **Lily**: No, I want the original. And you're welcome for helping at this awful party.
- **Zari**: You're right. You hate this stuff. Thanks for putting up with it… for me.
- **Lily**: Don't get used to it.

Lily decided to help with the party because she wanted her favorite horror movie back from Hannah — she had lent it to her a few weeks **earlier** and **hadn’t gotten** it back yet.

Lily 决定帮忙办派对，是因为她想从 Hannah 那里拿回自己最喜欢的恐怖电影 — 那是她几周前借出去的，但一直没还回来。

### Practice History

**Why did Lily help with the party?**

Lily helped/ because / frome Hannah

Lily helped with the party because she wanted to get her favorite horror movie back from Hanna which she **loaned** to Hannah weeks ago.

> Corrections:

1. “which she loaned to Hannah” → “the one she had lent her” 更地道自然，且使用正确的过去完成时
2. “loaned” 虽然没错，但在口语中 “lent” 更常见

Lily helped with the party because she wanted to get her favorite horror movie back from Hannah — the one she had **lent** her weeks ago.
