# The Ski Trip

Oscar and Eddy are on a skiing trip with students from the school where they teach. They're riding a **chairlift** together. Oscar moves around uncomfortably.

- **Oscar**: Eddy, why are you riding with me? This chair is too small for the two of us!
- **Eddy**: I never miss a chance to sit with my best friend!
- **Oscar**: As I've said before, we're not best friends.

Suddenly, the chairlift stops in midair. They don't see anyone else around.

- **Oscar**: Why did we stop?
- **Eddy**: I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

Oscar points at some clouds in the distance.

- **Oscar**: That storm looks threatening...
- **Eddy**: It's so far away! We'll be fine over here.

Dark clouds quickly gather above the chairlift. Oscar shouts for help.

- **Oscar**: Is anybody out there?! It's an emergency!

No one answers. The chairlift starts to swing in the wind.

- **Oscar**: This is terrible! I've been working my entire life to be a great artist. If we don't get down safely, I'll never be famous enough to have my paintings shown at the **Louvre**!
- **Eddy**: Just **stay calm**, Oscar.

Birds fly away from the storm as Oscar desperately calls out to the sky.

- **Oscar**: Universe, please save me! Although I'm already incredible, I can try to be even better!

Snow starts falling, and Oscar begins to cry.

- **Oscar**: I'll do anything!
  - I'll even be nicer to Eddy!

Suddenly, the chairlift starts working again, carrying them safely to the top of the hill.

- **Eddy**: I guess the universe wants us to be best friends after all! Do you want to get some lunch?
- **Oscar**: I think we've spent enough time together for one day.

Suddenly, lightning **strikes** above.

- **Oscar**: On second thought, I'd love to buy you lunch, Eddy.

## Writing

### Why do you think Oscar decided to buy Eddy lunch in the end?

I think he **believes** the **universe** heard his wish to treat Eddy better so the lightning can stop.

> Corrections:

1.  **"so the lightning can stop"**
    - tense mismatch. The verb "can" is present tense, but the sentence implies a past wish or hope.
    - Use **"would"** instead to match the implied hypothetical or past context.

I think he **believes** the **universe** heard his wish to treat Eddy better, so the lightning **would** stop.

---

I think he will buy lunch for Eddy, though he doesn't like Eddy. There was sign that the universe made to let him believe he should treat Eddy nicer.

I think he will buy lunch for Eddy, **even** though he doesn't like Eddy. There was **a** sign that the universe made to let him believe he should treat Eddy nicer.

> Corrections:

1. “treat Eddy nicer” should be “treat Eddy more nicely” or “treat Eddy better” (comparative form).
2. “There was a sign that the universe made” sounds awkward. A better phrasing would be “There was a sign from the universe”.

I think he will buy lunch for Eddy, **even** though he doesn't like Eddy. There was **a** sign **from the universe** that **made him** believe he should treat Eddy better.
