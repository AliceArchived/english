# The Poetry Club - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

And the worst part? My friend Zari is in the club. She loves poems and wants me to join too. She won't stop asking about it. But I'd rather read a scary novel alone.

Our school just started a new poetry club. Everyone says it's great because students can read poems and meet other poets. The club even has refreshments, like cookies and juice.

I hate it. I don't like poems. They are often confusing, and I don't understand them. Plus, reading poems in front of other people sounds horrible. I don't need everyone looking at me.

The club meets every Friday after school, right when I want to go home. They say the club is fun, but I doubt that. Everyone claps and acts like the poems are nice. It seems so fake.

We need to get rid of this poetry club. It's not for me. I'd rather stay home and watch a horror movie with my dog, Harold. I don't need to listen to poems or applause.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why do you think Lily dislike poetry so much?**

I think Lily dislikes the poetry club because she **finds** it fake or **overly dramatic**. Maybe she prefers things that feel more **down-to-earth** — even though she enjoys horror movies. In the end, it seems **authenticity** isn’t the main issue; perhaps she just needs a different kind of **creative outlet**, like a movie club.

我觉得 Lily 不喜欢诗歌社，是因为她觉得它虚伪或太夸张了。也许她更喜欢脚踏实地、真实一些的东西 — 尽管她也喜欢恐怖电影。说到底，真实性可能并不是关键问题；也许她只是需要一种不同形式的创意表达，比如电影社。

### Practice History

**Why do you think Lily dislike poetry so much?**

I think/ Maybe Lily / It seems

I think Lily doesn't like **the** poetry club because she thinks it is too fake. Maybe Lily like some real things, but she likes horror movies. It seems **that** whether things **are** fake or not doesn't matter **;** maybe she **could** join a movie club.

> Corrections:

1. “Lily like” → 应为 “Lily likes” 主谓一致
2. “some real things” → 改为 “things that feel more real” 更自然地道
3. “It seems that whether things are fake or not doesn’t matter” → 重写为 “doesn’t really matter to her” 更加完整和逻辑连贯
4. 分号前后需要结构对等，做了轻微调整

I think Lily doesn’t like the poetry club because she feels it’s too fake. Maybe Lily prefers things that feel more real — although she likes horror movies. It seems that whether something is fake or not doesn’t really matter to her; maybe she could join a movie club instead.

我觉得 Lily 不喜欢诗歌社，是因为她觉得那太虚伪了。也许她喜欢真实一点的东西，虽然她也喜欢恐怖电影。看起来东西真不真实对她来说其实没那么重要；也许她可以考虑加入电影社。
