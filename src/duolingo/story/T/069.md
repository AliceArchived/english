# The Rejection Business - B2

Are you afraid of delivering bad news? I'm not. After years of saying no to people, I've turned it into a business. Now you can pay me $20 to reject anyone for literally any reason. Here are some examples from the past week:

"Lydia wishes she could be your lab partner, but she wants a good grade and you're bad at chemistry."

"Sorry, Michael doesn't intend to go to any costume party, especially not one where everyone has to dress up as an **element of the periodic table**."

"Christa promises to come to one of your future violin concerts — but not this one. Right now, you're so bad that your playing gives her a headache."

No rejection is too small. You can trust my **satisfied** customers:

Michelle, happy customer:

- **Michelle**: Lily doesn't care what people think, so she's the perfect person to deliver bad news.

Keisha, happy customer:

- **Keisha**: I'm so popular that eight guys asked me to the dance.
  - Lily rejected all eight of them in a group text. Easy!

Eddy, sad dad:

- **Eddy**: Lily hit me with a **paper airplane** that said, "Junior is quitting baseball."
  - I'm sad Junior doesn't want to be on the team I coach, but I am impressed by Lily's **aim**.
  - She'd be great on the team!

And for the small price of $5, I can also make the perfect playlist of sad songs to comfort the people you've rejected.

Would you pay Lily to deliver your bad news? Why or why not?

Personally, I wouldn't pay someone **just to** deliver bad news for me — at least not in my current situation. Unless I run my own business one day and need to make difficult announcements to employees or customers, I think it's more **responsible** and **cost-effective** to handle uncomfortable situations myself. As **an ordinary person**, learning to deal with conflict directly is an important life skill, and it also helps me grow **emotionally**.

就我个人而言，我不会为了传达坏消息而付钱请别人——至少在我目前的生活中不会。除非将来我自己开公司，需要向员工或客户宣布一些棘手的事情，否则我觉得亲自处理不愉快的场面既更负责任，也更省钱。作为普通人，学会直接面对冲突是一项重要的生活技能，也有助于情绪上的成长。

### Practice History

Would you pay Lily to deliver your bad news? Why or why not?

I don't think I will pay anyone to just say bad news unless one day I have my own business. As a normal person, it's better for me to handle conflict myself and save money.

1. “to just say bad news” is awkward;
   - use “just to deliver bad news” or
   - “just to tell someone bad news.”
2. “unless one day I have my own business” would sound smoother as “unless I have my own business **one day**.”
3. The second sentence could flow better with “it's better **for someone like me** to handle conflict myself.”

I don't think I **would** pay anyone just to **deliver bad news**, unless I have my own business **one day.** As an **ordinary** person, it's better **for someone like me** to handle conflict myself and save money.

I don't think I need this service. The business is a good idea, but for me **rejecting** people is not a problem. **I** need to save money, so I can do it myself.

> Corrections:

1. "rejecting people is not a problem"
   - grammatically okay, but the tone may sound a bit harsh. You might mean "saying no to people" or "turning people down."
2. "I need to save money, so I can do it myself."
   - clear, but can be made smoother by combining ideas.

I don't think I need this service. The business is a good idea, but for me, **saying no** to people **isn't difficult**. I need to save money, so I'd **rather** handle it myself.

I don't think I will pay ~~any one~~ money simply to deliver bad news. As a normal person, who has limited money, I think paying money just for deliver bad news is a luxury which I ~~shouldn't do~~ it. And also I need to handle such things myself.

> Corrections:

1. “any one”
   - → should be **“anyone”** (one word).
2. “simply to deliver bad news”
   - → correct, but can be made smoother in context.
3. “a luxury which I shouldn't do it”
   - → incorrect phrasing; should be **“a luxury I shouldn't allow myself”** or **“a luxury I can't afford”**.
4. “And also I need to handle such things myself”
   - → can be simplified to **“I should handle such things myself.”**

I don't think I would pay anyone just to deliver bad news. As **an ordinary person** with limited money, I think that's a luxury I can't afford. Besides, I should handle such things myself.
