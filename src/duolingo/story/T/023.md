# The Box of Spirits - B3

Eddy and Junior are in the garage, looking at a large, dusty box.

- **Eddy**: Junior, help me move this box. It's heavy.
- **Junior**: I can't touch that box, Dad.
- **Eddy**: Why not? It's just a box!
- **Junior**: No. Dad. That box holds ancient **spirits**.

Eddy blinks and looks at the box.

- **Eddy**: Ancient spirits?
- **Junior**: Yes, it'd release them if we move it. They'd cause bad luck.
- **Eddy**: Hmm. When did you learn about this?
- **Junior**: I read it online. You should trust me!

Eddy kneels and **pokes** the box carefully.

- **Eddy**: The spirits seem quiet. Maybe they won't mind if you help me.
- **Junior**: No way! I won't risk it.
- **Eddy**: OK, I'll do it myself. But spirits like **offerings**, right?
- **Junior**: Uh, I guess… Why?

Eddy walks out of the garage. He returns with a bag of snacks.

- **Eddy**: I'll use your snack stash to "appease" them. You'd agree to that, right?
- **Junior**: Wait, my snacks?

Eddy opens a bag of chips.

- **Eddy**: Yep. Spirits love chips!
- **Junior**: OK, fine! I'll help move the box. Just leave my snacks alone!
- **Eddy**: Hmm! I thought we couldn't move it?
- **Junior**: I was wrong. The spirits will be fine.

Junior quickly helps Eddy move the box.

- **Eddy**: Well, what do you know? No spirits released!
- **Junior**: Just don't touch my snacks again, Dad!

## Speaking

**Why does Junior refuse to move the box?**

Junior refuses to move the box because he strongly believes it contains ancient spirits. He thinks that **disturbing** the box might release these spirits into the world, which could bring bad luck or even harm. His decision is **driven** by **fear and respect for the unknown**, and he would rather avoid any potential consequences than take the risk of unleashing something supernatural. This belief shows how deeply he is influenced by traditional stories or spiritual warnings passed down through generations.

Junior 拒绝搬动那个箱子，是因为他坚信里面封印着古老的灵魂。他认为如果打扰这个箱子，可能会释放这些灵魂到世间，带来厄运甚至伤害。他的决定出于对未知的恐惧和尊重，相比冒险触发某种超自然现象，他更愿意选择避免。这个信念也反映出他深受传统故事或世代流传的灵异警示影响。

Although Junior says he refuses to move the box because it contains ancient spirits and could bring bad luck, it seems more like an excuse to get out of doing chores. His **dramatic explanation** might be **rooted** in family tales or personal superstition, but the **timing** and **convenience** suggest he’s simply avoiding responsibility. This **reflects** a common behavior where people use creative reasoning or fears to **dodge** tasks they dislike — especially when it comes to household duties.

虽然 Junior 表面上说他不愿意搬箱子，是因为箱子里有古老的灵魂，搬动会带来厄运，但这更像是他用来逃避做家务的借口。他的说法可能和家族传说或迷信有关，但从时间点和动机来看，更像是为了躲懒。这种行为其实很常见，人们常会用夸张的理由或恐惧来逃避不喜欢的任务，尤其是家务活。

- dodge: 英 /dɒdʒ/, 美 /dɑːdʒ/
  - vt. & vi. 闪躲

#### Why "convenience" and not "motive"?

- “Motive” refers to a person’s internal reason or intention for doing something.
  - Example: His motive was to avoid chores.
- “Convenience” refers to how suitable or easy something is in a given situation — it’s often used when something just happens to work out nicely for someone, even if they don't admit the motive directly.
  - Example: It was convenient for him that the box seemed scary — he didn’t have to move it.

#### Why “convenience” fits better here

“The timing and convenience suggest he’s simply avoiding responsibility.”

This phrasing works well because:

- Junior **doesn’t openly admit** that he wants to skip chores.
- Instead, the situation — a box with “ancient spirits” — is **convenient** for him to justify his refusal **without sounding lazy**.
- It subtly implies **his actions align with his interest**, even if he pretends it's about danger or superstition.

所以这里用“convenience”，是表达一种 “刚好借题发挥、顺水推舟” 的感觉，而不是直接指责他说谎或有不良动机，这样更符合英语中的委婉表达，也更自然地贴近 IELTS 的语言逻辑。

### Practice History

**Why does Junior refuse to move the box?**

Junior refuses / because / bad luck

Junior refuses to move the box because he **believes** it holds ancient **spirits**, moving it will release old spirits and **bring** bad luck.

> Corrections:

1. Sentence structure needs better parallelism: “moving it will release old spirits and bring bad luck” → “moving it would release them and bring bad luck” (to match the hypothetical belief).
2. “because bad luck” is an incomplete fragment — needs full structure.

Junior refuses to move the box because he **believes** it holds ancient spirits — moving it **would** release them and bring bad luck.

Junior 拒绝搬动这个箱子，因为他相信里面封印着古老的灵魂，搬动它会释放这些灵魂并带来厄运。

> Corrections:

1. The original version only reflects the surface reason (fear of spirits), but the underlying motivation is more likely laziness or avoidance.
2. This dual-layer interpretation better matches the story's tone and subtle humor.

Junior refuses to move the box because he claims it contains ancient spirits — but **in truth**, it seems like he’s just using that as an excuse to avoid doing chores.

Junior 拒绝搬箱子，说是因为箱子里封印着古老的灵魂，搬动会带来厄运，但实际上他只是找借口逃避做家务而已。
