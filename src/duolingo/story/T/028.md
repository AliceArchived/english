# The Boy I Love

Zari is babysitting Junior. They are watching a movie.

Zari starts to cry.

- **Junior**: Zari? What's wrong?
- **Zari**: Nick broke my heart!
- **Junior**: Who's Nick?
- **Zari**: The boy I love!
  - I thought Nick was perfect. He was so **talented**.
  - But he did something terrible, and I can never forgive him.
- **Junior**: That's awful!
- **Zari**: I know!
- **Junior**: Zari, **put on** your shoes.
- **Zari**: What are you doing?

Junior goes to the kitchen and gets some eggs.

- **Junior**: I saw this on TV once. We have to throw eggs at Nick's house.

Zari stops crying.

- **Zari**: Wait, what?
- **Junior**: You'll feel better! And if you don't, we can cover his trees with **toilet paper**!
- **Zari**: Oh no, Junior, we can't do that.
- **Junior**: Why not?
- **Zari**: Because â€¦ I don't know where he lives.
- **Junior**: You don't know where your boyfriend lives?
- **Zari**: Oh, Nick isn't my boyfriend!
- **Junior**: He's not?
- **Zari**: No, Nick is my favorite actor.
  - He's in the movie we're watching right now.
- **Junior**: He is?
- **Zari**: Yes, and his acting is terrible!
  - Now I never want to see him again!
