# The Cheese Tasting - B3

Oscar and Eddy arrive at a wine and cheese tasting. Oscar looks annoyed.

- **Oscar**: Eddy, I persuaded you to come because Lucy canceled. Please, behave. This is an important event for me.
- **Eddy**: Don't worry, Oscar! I love cheese. Cheese is like… the pizza of fancy food!
- **Oscar**: Cheese is not pizza, Eddy. Just stay calm and don't embarrass me.

They walk to a table full of cheese cubes. Oscar picks up a tiny fork.

- **Oscar**: Use the little forks, Eddy. Be polite.

Eddy ignores him and grabs cheese cubes with his fingers.

- **Eddy**: Wow, this cheese is good! This one tastes like socks, but in a good way!
- **Oscar**: Eddy! Stop yelling about socks! People are looking at us.

Eddy keeps eating, smiling, and loudly **commenting on** every piece of cheese.

- **Eddy**: What's that smell? Oh, this one smells like a gym bag! Amazing!

People nearby start laughing.

A man with a notebook joins the crowd, watching Eddy eat. He whispers to someone.

- **Oscar**: Eddy, stop! Everyone thinks you're ruining the event!
- **Eddy**: What? I'm just enjoying the food.

The next day, Oscar gets a call.

- **Oscar**: A wine magazine? You're writing about me?

The article praises Oscar for "redefining culture" with "bold, honest dining."

- **Eddy**: See? I saved the day! We make a great team!
- **Oscar**: No, Eddy. I make the team. You are just… the loud cheerleader.

## Vocabulary

- The article praises Oscar for "redefining culture" with "**bold**, honest dining."
  - bold: brave

## Style

- Eddy keeps eating, smiling, and loudly **commenting on** every piece of cheese.
  - "**commenting on**" — stylistically **awkward** in this context.
  - Correction: commenting on → **commenting about** (or simply “commenting on every cheese” if you prefer more formal tone — but "**about**" sounds more natural with **“loudly”**)

### Practice History

**Why did people start laughing at Eddy?**

People laughed/ described/ smelled

People laughed at Eddy because he described the cheese in **an** honest, vivid way. Such as a type of cheese tasted like smelled socks.

> Corrections:

1. “in an honest, vivid way” → 正确，但两个形容词之间需加 and 来连接
2. “tasted like smelled socks” → 应为 “tasted like smelly socks”（形容词 smelly 修饰 socks）
3. “such as” → 用 “for example” 引导句子更自然•
