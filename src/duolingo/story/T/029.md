# The Contracts Class - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

Our school introduced a new contracts class for students who want to learn about legal agreements. Everyone says it's a great way to get tips on managing paperwork and understanding contracts, which will be useful for future jobs.

I hate it. There can't be anything more boring than learning about contracts. It's just a class where they teach you about long papers filled with rules and signatures. Basically, it's a nightmare for anyone who just wants to draw and listen to music.

This class requires us to work in teams to solve problems and manage projects. Sorry, did you say "team"? I'm not a person who likes working with others. I'd rather handle things **alone**, away from everyone else.

Plus, the teacher gives us tips on how to make good deals and manage contracts. It's supposed to be helpful. But there's the thing that I don't get: why would anyone choose to read big, boring contracts for fun? I think I'd rather watch paint dry.

We should drop the contracts class. Maybe some students will find it useful. But I don't need to know about contracts. I just want to listen to my music and draw alone.

## Vocabulary

## Style

- "Basically, it's a nightmare for anyone who just wants to draw and listen to music."
  - Style suggestion: "For someone who just wants to draw and listen to music, it's a nightmare."
  - **Avoids starting with “Basically,”** which weakens tone; improves clarity.
- "Sorry, did you say 'team'?"
  - Style suggestion: "**Wait** — did you say 'team'?" -** “Sorry” can sound passive or unclear in tone**; “Wait” adds clearer sarcasm and matches the narrator’s voice better.
- "But **there's** the thing that I don't get:"
  - Style suggestion: "But **here's** what I don't get:"
  - Smoother phrasing; “there’s the thing” is clunky and informal even for casual tone.

## Sentences

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

I think Lily dislikes the contracts class mainly because she doesn't have enough **real-world experience** to understand its importance. When people **haven’t yet** dealt with contracts in real life — like renting an apartment or signing up for services — it's hard to see why they matter. Maybe she also had trouble working with others, which made the class more frustrating. In my opinion, learning about contracts is essential, because in real life, avoiding them is nearly impossible.

我认为 Lily 不喜欢合同课，主要是因为她没有足够的现实生活经验，无法理解它的重要性。当一个人还没有经历过真实的合同，比如租房或注册服务时，很难意识到合同的意义。也许她在课堂上与他人合作不顺利，这让她更反感这门课。在我看来，了解合同是非常必要的，因为在现实生活中，几乎无法避免接触合同。

### Practice History

**Why do you think Lily dislikes the class?**

Helpful Phrases: Lily dislikes it/ I think she/ Maybe it's because

Lily dislikes the contract class which I think she just doesn't have enough practical life experiences. Maybe it's because she didn't cooperate with others enough. In real life, I can't imagine anyone **avoiding** contracts.

> Corrections:

1. "which I think she just doesn't have…" is grammatically awkward.
2. The sentence needed clearer structure — the em dash was not misused, but clearer punctuation was required.
3. “contract class” should be “**contracts class**” to match the story title.
4. "which I think is because…" improves clarity and coherence.

Lily dislikes **the contracts class**, which I think **is because** she **lacks** enough practical life **experience**. Maybe it's **also** because she didn’t cooperate with others enough. In real life, I can't imagine anyone **avoiding** contracts.

Lily 不喜欢合同课，我认为是因为她缺乏足够的实际生活经验。也许是因为她没有很好地与他人合作。在现实生活中，我无法想象有人会回避合同。
