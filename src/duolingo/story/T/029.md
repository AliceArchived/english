# The Cat Rule

Eddy and Junior are taking care of a neighbor's cat. The cat is sleeping on Junior's lap.

- **Eddy**: Junior, you need to wash the dishes.
- **Junior**: I can't do that now, Dad. It's the Cat Rule.
- **Eddy**: What's the Cat Rule?
- **Junior**: If a cat is sleeping on your lap, you can't stand up to do anything.
- **Eddy**: Hmm. I've never heard of the Cat Rule...
- **Junior**: So, Dad, can you bring me a drink?
- **Eddy**: Can't you get it yourself?
- **Junior**: No! Cat Rule!
- **Eddy**: Ugh, OK.

Eddy puts a glass of juice on the table.

- **Junior**: Can you move the glass closer to me? I can't reach it because the cat is on my lap. Cat Rule!

Eddy moves the glass closer to Junior.

- **Junior**: And can you also give me the remote control? I want to watch something on TV, but —
- **Eddy**: The Cat Rule. Yeah, yeah, I know.

Eddy leaves the room for a while, then he returns.

- **Junior**: Junior, when are you going to wash the dishes?
- **Eddy**: I can't do anything until the cat wakes up!

Eddy tries to move the cat.

- **Eddy**: Hey, cat —
- **Junior**: Don't wake the cat up on purpose, Dad! That's mean!
- **Eddy**: That cat has been sleeping for quite a while...
- **Junior**: He had a busy day.

Someone knocks on the door.

- **Eddy**: Do you want to answer the door? Oh right, you can't. Cat Rule, right?

Eddy answers the door and comes back with pizza.

- **Junior**: You ordered my favorite pizza!
- **Eddy**: And now I'm going to eat the whole pizza by myself in the kitchen! **I'd** share with you, but you can't stand up. Cat Rule!

## Writing

### Do you prefer cats or dogs? Why?

I prefer cats since I had one before. Cats can take care of themselves but dogs need to be walked **every day**. Cats are more **independent**, that's what I like too.

> Correction:

1. “since I had one before”
   - 建议更自然地表达为 “because I used to have one”。
2. “that's what I like too”
   - 稍显口语化，正式表达应为 “and I like that quality as well” 或 “which is a quality I also appreciate”。

I prefer cats **because I used to** have one. Cats can take care of themselves, while dogs need to **be walked** every day. Cats are more **independent**, which is **a quality** I also **appreciate**.

我更喜欢猫，因为我以前养过一只。猫能自己照顾自己，而狗每天都需要遛。猫更独立，而我也欣赏这种特质。

I prefer cats. I raised both cats and dogs before, they both were very cute. But dogs need to be walked every day, and cats can stay inside all the time. So it's more convenient for me to have a cat.

> Correction:

1. “I raised both cats and dogs before”
   - 建议改为更自然的表达 “I’ve raised both cats and dogs before”。
2. “they both were very cute”
   - 语法没错，但更自然的时态为 “they were both very cute”。
3. “So it's more convenient for me to have a cat.”
   - 更正式写法可为 “so having a cat is more convenient for me”。

I prefer cats. **I’ve raised** both cats and dogs before, and they were both very cute. But dogs need to be walked every day, **while** cats can stay inside all the time. So having a cat is more convenient for me.

我更喜欢猫。我以前养过猫也养过狗，它们都非常可爱。但狗每天都需要遛，而猫可以一直待在家里。所以养猫对我来说更方便。

I prefer cats. I **have** raised both cats and dogs before **;** they **were** both very cute. **However**, dogs need to be walked every day, **while** cats can stay inside all the time. **Therefore**, it's more convenient for me to have a cat.

我更喜欢猫。我以前养过猫也养过狗，它们都非常可爱。然而，狗每天都需要遛，而猫可以一直待在屋里。因此，对我来说养猫更方便。

### Since VS because

**“since”** 和 **“because”** 都可以表示“因为”，但它们的语气、语境和侧重点略有不同。

| 用法        | since                                                          | because                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ 共同点   | 都可作“因为”，引导原因从句                                     | 同上                                                             |
| 🌟 语气     | 较温和，语气轻描淡写                                           | 语气较强，强调直接原因                                           |
| 🎯 用途重点 | 更常用于表达已知、明显、背景性原因                             | 用于解释“主要/关键”的原因                                        |
| 📍 例子     | I didn’t go out **since** it was raining. （因为下雨，没出门） | I didn’t go out **because** it was raining. （因为下雨，没出门） |
| 💬 翻译感觉 | 语气像：“反正都……”，“既然……”                                   | 语气像：“就是因为……所以……”                                       |

#### 语气轻重不同：

- **Since** you’re here, let’s start the meeting.
  - 👉（既然你已经到了，那我们就开会吧。）
  - → “since” 是背景信息，不是句子核心重点。
- **Because** you’re here, I feel much better.
  - 👉（正因为你在，我感觉好多了。）
  - → “because” 强调“你在”是“我感觉好”的**关键原因**。

#### 正式写作建议：

在**写作中**：

- 用 **because** → 更明确、逻辑更清晰，适合解释原因。
- 用 **since** → 适合轻描淡写、语境明确时（如演讲、日常对话）。
