# The New Boy - B3

Zari and Lily are sitting in the school courtyard. Zari is staring at Caleb, the new boy.

- **Lily**: You're staring again.
- **Zari**: I'm not staring!
- **Lily**: You're obviously staring. Do you like him?
- **Zari**: What? No! I mean… maybe. He's just so… cute.
- **Lily**: Then why don't you go talk to him?
- **Zari**: I don't know what to say! What if he thinks I'm weird?

Lily stands up suddenly.

- **Zari**: Wait! Where are you going?
- **Lily**: To fix your problem.

Lily walks over to Caleb while Zari hides her face with her hands. A moment later, Lily returns, **smirking**.

- **Zari**: What did you do?
- **Lily**: Don't be mad, but I told Caleb you need a partner for the trivia team.
- **Zari**: You WHAT?!
- **Lily**: Relax. He agreed to help you. He's coming to meet you after school to work on it.

Zari looks horrified at first, then starts to smile.

- **Zari**: Really? Wow… I mean, I guess that's good. But I wasn't ready for this!
- **Lily**: You'd never be ready. Sometimes, people need a little push.

Zari thinks for a moment and then laughs.

- **Zari**: You just want me to say thank you, don't you?
- **Lily**: That, and I'm rooting for you two to get together.
