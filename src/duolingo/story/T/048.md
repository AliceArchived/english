# The Lonely Frog - B2

Eddy **rushes around** the apartment with a broom, cleaning as fast as he can. He enters the kitchen to find the sink filled with frogs.

- **Eddy**: Junior! My date is coming over soon! Why are there dozens of frogs in our sink?!

A frog jumps onto Eddy's head, causing Eddy to scream. Junior walks in and calmly removes the frog.

- **Junior**: I caught them outside this morning. I'm trying to help my frog, Sugar, meet other frogs so she can find a **companion**. She's **lonely**.
- **Eddy**: Fine. Keep a few frogs and take the rest outside while I get ready.

Junior follows Eddy to his bedroom. When Eddy tries to put on a more formal pair of pants, a frog jumps out of the pant leg.

- **Eddy**: Junior! This is unacceptable! There are too many frogs.
- **Junior**: **There's no such thing as too many frogs,** Dad.
- **Eddy**: Please take them back outside!
- **Junior**: Just cancel the date. We can have a nice night at home with the frogs.

Eddy **sighs** and sits down with Junior.

- **Eddy**: Junior, Sugar's lonely, right? Well, I'm lonely too. And I'm trying to find the right **companion**.
  - Don't you want me to be happy?
- **Junior**: Of course. Why didn't you just say that **in the first place**? Let's clean this place up.

Later, Eddy's date arrives. The apartment is **spotless**, and Eddy looks exhausted.

- **Eddy**: Junior, meet Angela.
- **Angela**: Hi, Junior! Your dad mentioned you love frogs, so I brought you a surprise.

Angela hands Junior a small tank with a frog in it.

- **Junior**: Wow, thanks! I'll put him with the others!

Junior takes the frog and opens the bathroom door. Dozens of frogs jump out. Angela looks horrified.

- **Eddy**: Uhh.. You know what they say… There's no such thing as too many frogs!

**Why did Junior put frogs in the sink?**

Junior put the frogs in the sink because he wanted to help his pet Sugar meet other frogs, so she wouldn’t feel lonely.

Junior 把青蛙放进水槽，是因为他想帮助他的宠物 Sugar 认识其他青蛙，这样她就不会感到孤单。

**Do you think Junior will get along with Angela? Why or why not?**

I don’t think Junior and Angela will get along. Although Angela is trying to be friendly, Junior has **far too many frogs** — and honestly, they would be really annoying in real life. I doubt that **any normal person** could tolerate that for long.

我觉得 Junior 和 Angela 不太可能相处得好。虽然 Angela 尽力表现得友好，但 Junior 的青蛙实在太多了，说实话，这在现实生活中会非常令人烦恼。我怀疑有哪个正常人能长时间忍受那样的情况。

---

I think Junior could actually get along with Angela. Although she seemed shocked at first when the frogs jumped out, she did bring him a frog as a gift, which really shows she **wanted to connect with him**. Since Junior loves frogs and Angela made the effort to understand that, I believe they could become friends — as long as she can get used to all those frogs.

我觉得 Junior 其实可能会和 Angela 相处得不错。虽然一开始青蛙跳出来时她看起来很吃惊，但她确实送了一只青蛙给 Junior 当礼物，这很明显说明她想和他建立联系。既然 Junior 喜欢青蛙，而 Angela 也努力去理解这一点，我相信他们可能会成为朋友——只要她能习惯那么多青蛙。

---

I believe Junior and Angela are likely to get along very well. **One strong indication** is that Angela brings Junior a frog-themed gift—she clearly knows he likes frogs and chose something he appreciates. This thoughtful gesture shows she cares about his interests and wants to make a positive impression. Their shared appreciation for frogs forms a genuine connection, which is an excellent foundation for their budding friendship.

我相信 Junior 和 Angela 很有可能相处得非常好。一个很明显的迹象是 Angela 带给 Junior 一份青蛙主题的礼物——她显然知道他喜欢青蛙，并挑选了他会喜欢的东西。这一贴心的举动表明她在意他的兴趣，并希望给他留下积极的印象。他们对青蛙的共同喜好形成了真诚的联系，这为他们正在萌芽的友谊奠定了良好的基础。

### Practice History

**Why did Junior put frogs in the sink?**

Junior put/ help his/ meet other

Junior put frogs in the sink to help his pet Sugar to meet other frogs so she will not feel lonely.

> Corrections:

1. “so she will not feel lonely” → should be “so she wouldn’t feel lonely” to match past tense (since the action is in the past).
2. “to help his pet Sugar to meet” → the “to” after “help” is unnecessary; “help someone meet” is correct.

Junior put frogs in the sink to help his pet Sugar meet other frogs so she **wouldn’t** feel lonely.

Junior 把青蛙放进水槽，是为了让他的宠物 Sugar 认识其他青蛙，这样她就不会感到孤单。

**Do you think Junior will get along with Angela? Why or why not?**

I think that Junior and Angela probably get along well. Junior likes frogs and Angela brings a gift for Junior with a frog. So Angela **doesn't** hate **frogs** and she wants to make a good impression **on** Junior. That's a very good start to **having** a good relationship.

> Corrections:

1. Changed “doesn’t hate frogs” to “isn’t afraid of frogs” to sound more natural.

I think Junior and Angela will probably get along well. Junior likes frogs, and Angela brings **him** a frog gift. That shows Angela isn’t afraid of frogs and wants to make a good impression on Junior — **a great start** to building a positive relationship.

我认为 Junior 和 Angela 很可能会相处得很好。Junior 喜欢青蛙，而 Angela 还带来了一个青蛙作为礼物。这表明 Angela 并不害怕青蛙，并且想给 Junior 留下好印象 — 这是建立良好关系的一个很好的开端。

> "That's a very good start to having a good relationship."
>
> After "a good start to," you must use a gerund (-ing form) rather than an infinitive (to + verb).
>
> The structure is always "start to" + gerund (-ing) in this context, meaning it should be "start to having."

在 "a good start to..." 后面应该使用动名词形式（having），而不是不定式（to have）。
因此，正确的表达是 "That's a very good start to having a good relationship."

---

I don't think that Junior will get along with Angela. Junior **has** too many frogs. Sure, Angela was trying to get along with Junior by **giving** him **a** frog as a gift, but not that **many** frogs.

I don't think that Junior will get along with Angela. Junior **has** a lot of frogs, but Angela didn’t know that. She gave him one as a gift to try to get along with him, but then she found out he already had so **many**. If Angela ends up living with Junior, I can’t imagine she’d be happy surrounded by that **many** frogs.

---

I think that Junior will not **get** along with Angela. Yes, Angela is trying to be nice to Junior, but Junior has too many frogs. They are annoying in real life. I don't think any normal ~~people~~ could stand with that.

> Corrections:

1. “any normal people could stand with that”

- “people” 是复数，不能和 “any” 搭配这种单一情境。
- “stand with that” 是中文直译，不自然。
- ✅ 建议改为：
  - **“any normal person could put up with that”** 或
  - **“anyone normal could tolerate that”**

2. “stand with”
   > - 通常表示“站在一起、支持”，而不是“忍受”。你这里想表达的是“忍受”，应使用：

- **put up with**（忍受）
- **tolerate**（容忍）
- **deal with**（应对）

I don’t think Junior will get along with Angela. **Even though** Angela is trying to be nice, Junior has **way too many** frogs **—and** they’re really annoying in real life. I don’t think any normal **person** could **put up with** that.

我觉得 Junior 不会和 Angela 合得来。虽然 Angela 想对他好，但 Junior 有太多青蛙了——在现实中真的很烦人。我不觉得任何一个正常人能忍受那种情况。

### Rewrite Version

I think Junior might **actually** get along with Angela. **Even though** she looked shocked at first when the frogs jumped out, she brought a frog as a gift for Junior, which shows she was trying to connect with him. Since Junior loves frogs, and Angela made the effort to understand that, they could become friends—if she can get used to all those frogs.

我觉得 Junior 可能真的能和 Angela 合得来。虽然刚开始青蛙跳出来时她很震惊，但她送给 Junior 一只青蛙作为礼物，这说明她试图和他建立联系。既然 Junior 喜欢青蛙，而 Angela 又愿意去了解他，他们可能会成为朋友——如果她能适应那一大堆青蛙的话。

I don't think Junior will get along with Angela. **Even though** she's trying to be nice, Junior has way too many frogs. **Most people** would find that **annoying** or **overwhelming**. Angela looked horrified when she saw all the frogs, so I doubt she’ll want to spend more time with him.

我认为 Junior 不会和 Angela 合得来。尽管她试图表现得友善，但 Junior 实在有太多青蛙了，一般人都会觉得烦或者受不了。当 Angela 看到那么多青蛙时，脸上的表情都吓坏了，我觉得她大概不太愿意再和 Junior 相处了。
