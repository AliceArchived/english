# The Coffee Artist

Oscar is at the counter of a new coffee shop.

- **Oscar**: This coffee is terrible!
- **Employee**: But this is the way I always make coffee.
- **Oscar**: You don't understand. The milk is too hot.
- **Employee**: I don't know what you want. I already made three coffees for you.
- **Oscar**: Please move. I'll show you how to make it.

Oscar goes behind the counter and makes a perfect cup of coffee.

**The employee tries it.**

- **Employee**: Wow, it's â€¦ amazing!
- **Oscar**: I know. A great cup of coffee is like art!

Another customer **walks over** to Oscar.

- **Customer**: One coffee, please.

Oscar makes another perfect coffee.

- **Customer**: Wow, this is the best coffee I've ever had!
- **Oscar**: I know.
- **Employee**: Please tell all your friends about our amazing coffee!

Hours later, there's a long line in front of the coffee shop. Eddy arrives.

- **Eddy**: Oscar! Do you work here now?
- **Oscar**: No, I don't! But no one else can make a great cup of coffee!
- **Eddy**: Are they paying you?
- **Oscar**: I'm not doing this for money. This is art.
- **Eddy**: So is the coffee free, then?
- **Employee**: No. A cup of coffee costs five dollars. And you have to **stand in line**.
