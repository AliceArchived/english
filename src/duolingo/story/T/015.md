# The Baby Photo

Zari runs into her neighbor Bea's apartment.

- **Zari**: Bea! Help!
- **Bea**: Zari, what's wrong? Are you OK?
- **Zari**: No! It's an emergency!
- **Bea**: Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?
- **Zari**: No, it's worse than bleeding!
- **Bea**: Worse?
- **Zari**: I accidentally sent an embarrassing picture to the **cutest** boy at my school.
- **Bea**: Oh no... this is worse.
- **Zari**: Right?!
- **Bea**: Show me the picture.
- **Zari**: Here it is...
- **Bea**: Is that...
- **Zari**: My baby photo? Yes, it is.
- **Bea**: Well... that's not terrible...
- **Zari**: I sent it with the text message "I have loved you since the day I was born."
- **Bea**: What?!
- **Zari**: I was trying to send it to my mom.
  - What should I do?! Tell me what to do, Bea.
- **Bea**: You can study a lot. Then, you can graduate from school early.
  - After that, you won't have to see him again!
- **Zari**: Bea...
- **Bea**: Or you can move to another city. I can help you find a job. Do you know how to fish?
- **Zari**: Bea!
- **Bea**: Don't worry, Zari. It's **embarrassing**, but you were so cute! (-ss-)
  - If you tell him it was an accident, he will understand.

Zari gets a text message.

- **Zari**: It's him!
- **Bea**: What does the message say?
- **Zari**: He ... doesn't recognize my number.
- **Bea**: That's great! He doesn't know the photo is from you!
- **Zari**: No, it's terrible! He doesn't even know who I am!

## Writing

### Have you ever sent a message by mistake?

Yes, I have sent a message by mistake. It didn't bother me. For me, I just explained to my friends that the message was sent by mistake, and my friend could **understand**.

> Corrections:

1. “my friend could understand”
   - → should be “my friend understood” or “my friend was able to understand” for correct tense and flow.
   - “could understand” isn't wrong grammatically, but sounds awkward here and mismatched in tense.
   - You're talking about a specific event in the past, so “understood” is more natural.
