# The Boxing Match

Lin and her grandmother, Lucy, are at a bar watching a boxing match.

- **Lin**: I'm leaving after I **finish** my drink, Grandma.
- **Lucy**: But this is the most important match **of** the year!
- **Lin**: I hate boxing. It's so boring.
- **Lucy**: No, it's exciting!
- **Lin**: It's just two men fighting while wearing big **leather gloves**.
- **Lucy**: They're not just men â€¦ They're **athletes**!
- **Lin**: They're just trying to win a stupid **trophy**.

Lin puts down her glass and walks away.

- **Lucy**: Where are you going?
- **Lin**: I'm going home to watch my favorite TV show.
- **Lucy**: The **dating show** about twenty men fighting **over** one woman?
  - They don't even win a **trophy**!
- **Lin**: No. But they're fighting for love.
- **Lucy**: Now that's boring.
