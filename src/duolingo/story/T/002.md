# Talking to Him - B3

Zari and Lily are sitting in the school library. Zari keeps glancing at a boy a few tables away.

- **Lily**: You've been staring at him for ten minutes. What's your plan?
- **Zari**: I'm just… um… thinking.
- **Lily**: Thinking? Or losing track of time because you're too nervous?

Zari pretends to read her book.

- **Zari**: I can't just **walk up to him**! What would I even say?
- **Lily**: I don't know. Maybe, "Hi"?
- **Zari**: What if he thinks I'm weird?
- **Lily**: Zari, you are weird. That's part of your charm.

Zari **groans** and **sinks into her chair**.

- **Zari**: No way. I can't do it.
- **Lily**: Fine. Then I'll go.

**Before** Zari can stop her, Lily gets up and **walks over** to the boy. Zari watches in horror.

- **Zari**: Lily! Wait—no!

Lily talks to the boy for a moment. Then, she comes back to their table.

- **Zari**: What did you just do?
- **Lily**: Long story short, he likes you.
- **Zari**: What? How do you know?
- **Lily**: Because I told him how you're obsessed with his study playlists.
- **Zari**: You what?!

Zari looks ready to faint.

- **Lily**: Relax! He thinks it's cute. He wants to grab coffee and listen to them with you this weekend.
- **Zari**: Are you serious?
- **Lily**: Yep. He's waiting for you to say yes.

Zari looks over at the boy, who smiles and waves.

- **Zari**: You are the worst… but also the best.
- **Lily**: I know.

# 和他说话 - B3

Zari 和 Lily 坐在学校图书馆里。Zari 一直偷瞄着几张桌子之外的一个男生。

- **Lily**：你盯着他看都十分钟了。你的计划是什么？
- **Zari**：我只是……嗯……在想事情。
- **Lily**：是在想事情，还是因为紧张而忘了时间？

Zari 假装读着她的书。

- **Zari**：我不能直接走过去！我该说什么？
- **Lily**：我也不知道。或许，“嗨”？
- **Zari**：万一他觉得我很奇怪怎么办？
- **Lily**：Zari，你本来就挺奇怪的，这就是你的魅力所在。

Zari 沮丧地瘫进椅子里。

- **Zari**：不行，我做不到。
- **Lily**：好吧，那我去。

Zari 还没来得及阻止，Lily 就站起来走向那个男生。Zari 惊恐地看着她。

- **Zari**：Lily！等等——别去！

Lily 和那个男生聊了一会儿，然后回到了她们的桌子前。

- **Zari**：你刚才做了什么？
- **Lily**：长话短说，他喜欢你。
- **Zari**：什么？你怎么知道的？
- **Lily**：因为我告诉他你超级喜欢他的学习歌单。
- **Zari**：你说了什么？！

Zari 看起来快晕过去了。

- **Lily**：放松点！他觉得很可爱。他想周末约你一起喝咖啡，顺便一起听歌单。
- **Zari**：你认真的吗？
- **Lily**：没错，他在等你答应呢。

Zari 看向那个男生，他微笑着挥了挥手。

- **Zari**：你真是太坏了……不过也真是太棒了。
- **Lily**：我知道啊。
