# The Mountain

Junior sits in class on a Monday morning. Everyone takes **out** their notebooks.

- **Teacher**: Who wants to read their essay about what they did this weekend?

Junior raises his hand.

- **Junior**: I want to read my essay!

Junior stands up and begins to read.

- **Junior**: On Saturday morning, I climbed an enormous mountain. I woke up very early. It was very cold...
- **Girl**: Which mountain?
- **Junior**: Please wait until I'm done to ask questions. Thank you.
  - I was all alone, and it was still dark when I started to climb.
- **Boy**: Is this true?
- **Junior**: Yes, it's true, Andy. Be **quiet**. (Be ~~quite~~)
  - I climbed for an hour and then I sat down to rest. I could hear wild dogs barking nearby. I was scared they were going to find me and eat me.
- **Boy**: You really climbed for an hour?
- **Junior**: I'm very **athletic**.
  - I climbed so high that I started to feel weak. I was so hungry. I didn't have any food.
  - I didn't have a phone to call for help.
  - Just as I reached the top of the mountain, I fainted.
- **Teacher**: Wow, Junior. This is an incredible story. You have quite an imagination.
- **Junior**: I didn't imagine it.
- **Girl**: What happened next, Junior!?
- **Junior**: My dad opened the door.
- **Girl**: What?
- **Junior**: Dad said, "Junior, why are you sitting on that pile of clothes I just washed? It looks like a mountain."
  - Then he said, "You need to fold all of those clothes if you want pancakes."
- **Girl**: So, wait... the story is you had to fold some clothes before your dad made you pancakes?
- **Junior**: Yes — and it almost killed me.

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Junior told a great story! What did you do on weekends as a kid?**

When I was a kid, I used to spend my weekends catching shrimp in a small stream near my home. I really enjoyed being outdoors and playing in nature. There were a lot of shrimp in the stream, but most of them were quite small. I caught them with my **bare hands**, so it wasn't easy to get many. Still, I had a lot of fun doing it — it was one of my favorite childhood activities.

我小时候常常在家附近的一条小溪里抓虾，几乎每个周末都会去。我非常喜欢在户外玩耍，亲近自然。溪里有很多虾，但大多数都很小。我是用手直接抓的，所以其实抓不到多少。不过我还是觉得特别有趣，那是我童年最喜欢的活动之一。

为什么这版更高分：

1. 使用了 过去完成习惯（used to spend...）
2. 有自然连接句（e.g., "Still, I had a lot of fun doing it"）
3. 动词时态统一（过去式）
4. 词汇多样（bare hands, outdoors, childhood activities）

### Practice History

**Junior told a great story! What did you do on weekends as a kid?**

I used to catch shrimp **in** a small stream when I was a kid. I loved **playing** outside and with nature. There ~~are~~ a lot of **shrimp** in **the** stream, but they ~~are~~ too small. And I **caught** these **shrimp** only by **hand**. So I couldn't catch many.

> Corrections:

1. "There are a lot of shrimp..."
   1. Error: Wrong tense. You're talking about the past, so it should be "There were" instead of "There are".
   2. "There were a lot of shrimp..."
2. "I loved playing outside and with nature."
   1. Minor awkwardness: While grammatically acceptable, “playing with nature” sounds a bit unnatural.
   2. Better phrasing: "I loved playing outside and being in nature" or "spending time in nature".
3. "I caught these shrimp only by hand."
   1. Stylistic issue: The placement of "only by hand" is slightly awkward.
   2. More natural: "I caught them with my bare hands" or "I only used my hands to catch them."

I used to catch shrimp **in** a small stream when I was a kid. I loved **playing** outside and **being** in nature. There **were** a lot of **shrimp** in the stream, but they were too small. And I caught them only by hand, so I couldn't catch many.

> Corrections:

1. **“play some toys”**
   - → 搭配错误，应为 **“play with toys”**
2. **“when I played it, there was sparks in it”**
   - → 语法错误，建议改为：
     - **“when I played with it, it made sparks”**
     - 或更自然的表达：**“that made sparks when I played with it.”**

I used to play **with** toys when I was a little kid. I still remember I had a toy gun that **made sparks** when I played with it.

> Accurate Version

I still remember I had a toy gun. When I **pulled the trigger**, it **made sparks** inside. It was one of my favorite toys as a kid.

我小时候常常玩玩具。我还记得我有一个玩具枪，每次玩它的时候里面会冒出火花。

| 你的原意         | 正确表达                             | 原因                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| “玩具枪”         | **toy gun**                          | “toy guy” 不标准，听不出意思               |
| “玩的时候有火花” | **made sparks** / **sparked inside** | 英文中描述火花常用 “spark” 作为动词或名词  |
| “玩的时候”       | **when I pulled the trigger**        | 更具体地描述“玩”的动作，尤其是枪的使用方式 |

### Formal

I used to have a toy gun when I was a kid. When I pulled the trigger, it **made** small **sparks** **inside** the gun. The sparks were completely **contained**, so it was safe to play with. I really loved that toy.
