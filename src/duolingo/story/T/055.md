# The New Coach - B2

"Local Coach Leads Team to Unbelievable Losses"

By Bryan Bell, Our Town Weekly

The local youth soccer team was known for winning every game over the last three years. However, when longtime coach Eddy left this season, things changed dramatically.

Eddy was replaced with an unusual choice: the local high school art and drama teacher, Oscar.

Coach Oscar has surprised the community with his interesting approach to soccer, which resulted in the team losing every game this season.

- **Oscar**: I can't stand sports or watching people play them.
  - I find it boring and uninspiring.

said Coach Oscar

It's not surprising, then, that the team was confused by his coaching style.

One player named Tommy said:

- **Tommy**: We don't actually play soccer at our practices anymore.
  - Instead, Coach Oscar makes us imagine being a soccer ball or sometimes even a tree.
  - It's really annoying.

In years past, parents would pick up sweaty, exhausted children from practice.

Last week, they were shocked to find the team wearing cat costumes, putting on an original musical.

Parents assumed this was to help the players work together better on the field. However, when questioned, Coach Oscar just shook his head and replied:

- **Oscar**: I wrote a musical, and I wanted to hear it out loud.
  - Is that a crime?

The parents of the soccer team noted that the search for a new coach is in progress.

**What do you think of Oscar's strategy as a coach?**

Honestly, I don’t think Oscar was an **effective coach**. Instead of focusing on **soccer training**, he had the kids play **musical instruments** and **march around**. While creativity is important, his methods had nothing to do with improving their soccer skills. A coach should help players build teamwork and technique, but Oscar seemed more interested in **putting on a show** than **preparing the team**. So yes, I believe he deserved to be fired.

说实话，我觉得奥斯卡并不是一个合格的教练。他没有专注于足球训练，反而让孩子们玩乐器、做队列表演。虽然创意也很重要，但他的方法完全没有帮助孩子们提升足球技巧。一个教练应该帮助队员提高配合能力和技术水平，但奥斯卡似乎更在意表演而不是比赛准备。所以我认为他被解雇是合理的。

The choice between “effective coach” and “qualified coach” depends on what you're trying to emphasize. Here's the difference:

1. "Qualified coach" = has the credentials or training
   Meaning: Oscar might have the background or certificate to be a coach.
   - ❗ But this doesn't mean he's good at coaching in practice.
   - ✅ Use "qualified" when you're talking about formal skills or requirements.
   - Example:
     - Oscar may be a **qualified coach**, but he doesn't seem to know how to train a team properly.
2. "Effective coach" = actually does the job well
   - Meaning: Oscar is (or isn't) good at producing real results—like improving players’ skills, leading the team, etc.
   - ✅ Use "effective" when you want to judge someone's performance or outcomes.
   - Example:
     - Oscar isn’t an effective coach because he didn't help the team improve.

### Practice History

**What do you think of Oscar's strategy as a coach?**

I think Oscar deserves to be fired. He didn’t do his job as a soccer coach. He didn’t train the kids at all — he just asked them to do some **musical activities**.
