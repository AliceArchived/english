# The Movie **Premiere**

Oscar is visiting his cousin Orson, an actor, in Hollywood.

- **Oscar**: I'm excited to go to your movie **premiere**! Look at my new suit!
- **Orson**: We don't have to wear suits.
  - No one will look at us. I'm only in the movie for a few minutes.
- **Oscar**: No! You should wear your best clothes.
  - Then we'll look like movie stars when the **photographer**s take our photo!
  - Also, I rented a **limo** for us!
- **Orson**: Oscar, no!

Oscar and Orson get in the limo. A mile from the theater, the limo stops.

- **Driver**: Sorry, the traffic is really bad.
- **Orson**: But the premiere starts in twenty minutes!
- **Oscar**: Let's run!

They get out of the limo and **step in mud**.

- **Oscar**: My shoes!

It starts raining.

- **Oscar**: My suit!

Oscar and Orson run to the theater.

When they arrive, they're wet and covered in mud.

A photographer takes their photo.

- **Photographer**: Wow, you look like you were in a war! Just like **characters** in the movie! (-s)
- **Orson**: Well, Oscar, you wanted us to look like movie stars!
