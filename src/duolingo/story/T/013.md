# The Art Department - B2

Oscar is working in the art department for the film "Teenage Vampires In love 2: Eternal Love."

Oscar's cousin Orson watches as he places **playing cards** in the shape of a house for a scene.

- **Orson**: Listen, I only was able to get you this job because I'm playing the vampire's father.
  - Remember, your job is to make whatever art that the director needs for the film set. As long as you do what he asks, everything will be fine.
- **Oscar**: Relax! The director asked me to set up cards. That's what I did. It's gorgeous!

As the director rushes in, he looks at the house of cards and frowns.

- **Director**: That looks too perfect.

The director knocks it down.

- **Oscar**: My art!
- **Director**: Now it looks like the vampires just finished playing a card game. It's **realistic**. I want **realism** on my set, Oscar - not beauty.
- **Oscar**: **Realism**! Vampires don't play cards — they don't even exist!
- **Orson**: Oscar, please don't argue!

Next, for an outdoor scene, Oscar pours dirt on the ground and carefully draws **geometric** shapes in the dirt with his finger.

- **Oscar**: Beautiful!

The director steps on the dirt, ruining Oscar's design.

- **Oscar**: My art!
- **Director**: Now it looks realistically dirty. Perfect!

Oscar angrily rushes to find Orson.

- **Oscar**: I quit! This director doesn't recognize my **brilliance**!
- **Orson**: Oscar, shhh!
- **Oscar**: Here's what I think of him and his "art"!

Oscar starts drawing the director as a vampire with a very large head.

- **Orson**: Stop! Someone might see that!
- **Director**: Too late.

They turn to see the director standing behind them.

- **Oscar**: I'm sorry!
- **Director**: Why? It's hilarious! I look great as a vampire!
  - Can you draw everyone in the cast as vampires? It's the perfect gift!
- **Oscar**: I never doubted that he would eventually recognize my brilliance!

## Writing

## How do you think Oscar feels now? Why?

I think he feels good now because the director likes his picture which **portrays** the director as a vampire. The director likes the ideas and **wants** to draw everyone in the cast using this style as a gift.

I think Oscar feels happy now, because his vampire **portrayal** was admired by the director.

- portray: 英 /pɔːˈtreɪ/, 美 /pɔːrˈtreɪ/
  - vt. 画像；描述,扮演
- portrayal: 英 /pɔː'treɪəl/, 美 /pɔr'treəl/
  - n. 画像，描述；描写，扮演；描摹，表现

## Sentences

- I only was able to get you this job...
  - Grammatically correct, but more natural word order would be:
  - _I was only able to get you this job..._
- 记住，你的工作是制作导演为片场所需的任何艺术品。只要你照他说的做，一切都会没问题的。
  - Remember, your job is to make whatever art that the director needs for the film set. As long as you do what he asks, everything will be fine.
- Oscar 的堂兄 Orson 看着他把扑克牌摆成一个房子的形状，用于一个场景。
  - Oscar's cousin Orson watches as he places playing cards in the shape of a house for a scene.
  - you can use “cards” instead of “playing cards”, but here’s the difference:
    - “Playing cards” (more specific – recommended here)
      - Refers clearly to standard deck cards (hearts, spades, etc.).
      - In this sentence, it's clear you mean cards used for games, which is the type often used to build card houses.
    - “Cards” (general – acceptable but less specific)
      - Grammatically correct.
      - But “cards” could also mean:
        - Greeting cards
        - Flashcards
        - Tarot cards
        - ID cards, etc.
    - “playing cards” 表达更清晰，意思是“扑克牌”；
      - 直接用 “cards” 语法没错，但意思较模糊，不一定是扑克牌；
      - 在这个语境下，建议保留 “playing cards” 更准确。

## Vocabulary

- Eternal Love: 永恒之爱
- the house of cards: 扑克牌搭成的
- hilarious: very funny
