# The Auction - B2

Oscar is selling his art at an **auction** organized by his friend Bea. **Disguised** in a huge hat, fake beard, and sunglasses, he's waiting for people to start **bidding** on his painting.

As his painting is brought to the front of the room, Oscar turns to a man standing beside him.

- **Oscar**: Now this is an incredible painting.
- **Man**: This? No, this painting is awful! No one would ever want it!

The man leaves.

- **Oscar**: How rude! That man has even worse taste than Eddy.

Bea starts the **bidding**.

- **Bea**: Does anyone want to bid $50 for this painting?
- **Eddy**: 50!

Oscar sees Eddy sitting up front.

- **Oscar**: Eddy is **bidding on** my painting? He has better taste than I thought.

Bea continues the auction.

- **Bea**: How about $60?

There's a long pause. Oscar looks around nervously as no one else places a bid.

- **Oscar**: $60!
- **Bea**: Do I hear $70?
- **Eddy**: 100!
- **Bea**: Wow, $100! Do I hear $120?
- **Oscar**: $1000!
- **Eddy**: 1000?! I can't afford that.
- **Bea**: Sold! For $1000!
- **Oscar**: I can't believe I spent $1000. But wait until everyone hears how much my painting is worth!

After the auction, Eddy approaches Oscar, who is still in disguise. Eddy doesn't recognize him.

- **Eddy**: Congratulations! That artist is one of the best in our city.
- **Oscar**: Do you really think so?
- **Eddy**: Of course! You're lucky to have it.

Eddy starts walking away, but Oscar stops him.

- **Oscar**: Wait! You should have it.
- **Eddy**: But I can't afford that.
- **Oscar**: Don't worry about it ... I'll give it to you for $100. You deserve it more than me.
- **Eddy**: I can't believe this. Thanks so much! It's going to look great in my bathroom.
- **Oscar**: Bathroom?! You're putting my painting in your bathroom?!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why does Oscar bid $1000 for his own painting?**

Oscar decided to bid $1000 on his own painting because no one else was interested in buying it. The **audience** didn’t see much value in the **artwork**, so he **stepped in** to make sure it wasn’t completely ignored.

Oscar 之所以出价 1000 美元买下自己的画，是因为现场没有其他人愿意出价购买。观众认为这幅画不值钱，所以他才出面出价，避免自己的作品被彻底忽视。

**Eddy really liked Oscar's painting! Imagine what the painting looks like and describe it.**

I imagine the painting **shows** a man and a woman in **a touching romantic moment** — maybe they’re **embracing** or **standing** together under a sunset. Since Eddy is quite sensitive and emotional about love stories, he probably saw something deeply meaningful in the **scene**, which explains why he was so moved by it.

我想象那幅画描绘的是一对男女在一个感人的浪漫场景中——也许他们正在拥抱，或者在夕阳下并肩而立。由于 Eddy 是一个很感性、容易被爱情故事打动的人，他可能在画中看到了某种深刻的情感，这也就解释了他为什么会被这幅画深深感动。

### Practice History

**Why does Oscar bid $1000 for his own painting?**

Oscar ~~bids~~ his own painting because no one in the place willing to pay more money on his painting. They don't think it is more valuable.

> Corrections:

1. "bids his own painting" → should be "bids **on** his own painting" (correct verb phrase)
2. "no one in the place willing" → needs "is": "no one **is** willing..."
3. "on his painting" → repeated unnecessarily; simplified version improves clarity
4. "They don't think it is more valuable" → more natural to say "They don’t think it’s worth much."

Oscar bids **on** his own painting because no one else **at the auction** **is** willing to pay more for **it**. They don’t think it’s **worth** much.

**Eddy really liked Oscar's painting! Imagine what the painting looks like and describe it.**

I think that the painting might be about **a** man and woman since Eddy is such a **sensitive** guy. He loves romantic stories and hope to find a true love for himself one day.

> Correction:

1. “**a** man and woman”
   - → should be **a man and a woman** for parallel structure.
2. “**hope** to find”
   - → subject-verb agreement error.
   - Should be **hopes**.

I think that the painting might be about **a** man and **a** woman, since Eddy is such a **sensitive** guy. He **loves** romantic stories and **hopes** to find true love for himself one day.

I think that painting might be **of** a man and a woman, since Eddy is a **sensitive** guy and **easily** touched by love stories. The painting **is** probably about a love story, so Eddy **has** been touched.

> Correction:

1. "might be of a man and a woman"
   - → grammatically correct, but “of” can be a bit vague. “Might **depict** a man and a woman” is clearer.
2. "since Eddy is a **sensitive** guy and easily touched by love stories"
   - grammatically fine, but "easily touched" is a bit awkward
   - "deeply moved" or "gets emotional" might flow better.
3. "so Eddy has been touched"
   - awkward ending. “Touched” is okay, but sounds a bit unnatural alone in this context.

I think that painting might **depict** a man and a woman, since Eddy is a sensitive guy who **gets emotional over** love stories. The painting is probably about a love story, which is why Eddy **was so moved**.

> Correction:

1. "gets emotional over" → better as "gets emotional **about**" (more natural collocation)
2. "guy" → "**person**" is slightly more formal for IELTS Speaking 7+
3. "about a love story" → changed to "about a **romantic scene**" to be more **vivid** and descriptive

I think the painting might **depict** a man and a woman, since Eddy is a sensitive person who **gets emotional about** love stories. The painting is probably about a **romantic scene**, which is why Eddy **was so moved**.
