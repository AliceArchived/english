# Thanks for the Bike - B2

From: lin@duomail.co

To: junior@duomail.co

**Subject: Thanks!**

Junior,

Thanks for lending me your bike yesterday while my motorcycle was being **repaired**.

Bea wouldn't let me use her bike because she says I'm "irresponsible" and that I "lose things," so I really appreciate your **generosity**.

And honestly, your bike is cooler than hers anyway.

But you know what's even cooler than biking? Walking! When you walk, it's easy to stop and look at a cool rock or a neat frog.

Plus, you can play an actual video game while you're walking. You can't do that on a bicycle unless you want to fall off.

Another option that's better than biking is skateboarding. Why be limited by two wheels when you can have four?

A bicycle is boring because it only moves forward instead of **in every direction**, and you also have to sit down while you ride. On a skateboard, you can stand up and even do tricks.

You'll be the coolest kid in school.

**Unrelated to all of the above**, I lost your bicycle. It wasn't my fault.

It happened when I smelled a barbecue at the park, so I **leaned** your bike against a tree and went to investigate.

An hour later, when I came back and looked for it again, it wasn't there.

But don't worry, whenever I lose something, I usually find it ... eventually.

I'll let you know when that happens.

Thanks again!

Lin
