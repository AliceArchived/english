# Thanks for the Memories - B2

From: Lucy@duomail.co

To: neighbors@duomail.co

**Subject: Thanks for the Memories**

My dear friends,

When I walked into my apartment and saw all of you screaming **at the top of your lungs**, I was terrified that the building was on fire. However, soon I realized that it was just a surprise birthday party. This was especially surprising for me because my birthday is next month!

I was very moved by **everyone's contributions to** make this party special. When I saw the single balloon tied to a chair, I knew that my granddaughter Lin must have been in charge of decorations. ("everyone's **efforts** to make this party special", Efforts” fits better here; “contributions to make” is a bit awkward.)

It was perfect because cleaning up at the end of the night was incredibly easy!

As I came to find out, Eddy was in charge of food, which explains why there was only a single bag of **stale** potato chips.

Everyone likes watching other people play video games, so I know we all enjoyed the Space Zombies tournament that Junior organized. However, it was only a single game, so no one other than Junior got a chance to play.

I also really appreciated the lovely single bottle of wine Oscar brought to the party and the extremely **informative** two-hour lecture he gave about the wine's origins.

I was worried that I was going to have to tell everyone to leave at the end of the night, but thanks to Oscar's lecture, everyone left **voluntarily**!

Thank you all for making me feel so loved. I had such a great time that I'm throwing myself another birthday party on my actual birthday next month!

See you there!

Lucy

## Writing

### Whose contribution to the party was the worst? Why?

I think Oscar's action was the worst. It's Lucy's birthday party, it's quite bad to show off at ~~other people's~~ party. They should focus on Lucy.

> 1. "other people's party" → should be "someone else's party" for natural phrasing.
> 2. Semicolon suggested after “party” for smoother flow: "It's Lucy's birthday party; it's quite bad..."

I think Oscar's action was the worst. It's Lucy's birthday party; it's quite bad to show off at other people's party. They should focus on Lucy.

我认为奥斯卡的行为最糟糕。那是露西的生日派对，在别人的派对上炫耀是非常不礼貌的。他们应该把注意力放在露西身上。

### Polished

I think Oscar’s contribution was the worst. He only brought one bottle of wine and gave a two-hour lecture about where it came from. **Instead of** making the party more fun, his long speech made everyone leave early. It wasn’t really a good way to celebrate Lucy’s birthday.

我认为 Oscar 的贡献最糟糕。他只带来了一瓶酒，还花了两个小时讲述酒的来历。他的冗长演讲让大家提前离开了派对，而不是让派对更有趣。这并不是庆祝 Lucy 生日的好方式。
