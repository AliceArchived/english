# Catering Chaos - B3

Bea has started a catering business. Today, she and Lin are preparing food for an engagement party.

- **Bea**: Lin, this is a big event. We need to follow my plan exactly. It's a mix of art and food. Small plates. Fancy shapes. Got it?
- **Lin**: Sure… but small plates? Doesn't that make people hungrier?
- **Bea**: No, Lin. This is about style, not sandwiches. Just stick to my menu and instructions.

Bea carefully arranges tiny appetizers on plates. Lin, meanwhile, looks unimpressed.

- **Lin**: Hmm… these look cute, but if I were a guest, I'd want something big.

Bea leaves the kitchen to check the decorations. Lin looks at the ingredients and gets an idea.

When Bea returns, she **freezes**. The fancy appetizers are gone.

- **Bea**: Lin! Where are my plates?
- **Lin**: Oh, I set up a sandwich bar instead. People can make their own.
- **Bea**: WHAT? You ruined everything!

Bea rushes to the party, preparing to apologize to the guests.

But when she looks around, everyone's laughing and building sandwiches. Even the couple looks happy.

- **Lin**: See? People love sandwiches.

The couple walks over and tells Bea they want her to cater their wedding.

- **Bea**: I… don't know what to say.
- **Lin**: Say, 'Thanks, Lin.'
- **Bea**: No! You still owe me for the appetizers.
- **Lin**: Fine… but I'll take payment in sandwiches.

**Why did Bea rush to the party?**

Bea rushed to the party in order to apologize to the guests. She had just discovered that Lin **had made an unexpected change** to the catering plan — replacing the originally planned small plates with a sandwich bar. This sudden switch did not align with the event's tone, and Bea feared it might disappoint or confuse the **attendees**. Wanting to take responsibility and manage the situation, she felt it was important to arrive quickly and explain the reason behind the change.

Bea 急匆匆地赶到派对，为的是向宾客道歉。她刚发现 Lin 临时更改了原本的小盘开胃菜计划，换成了一个三明治吧。这个突然的变化与活动的风格不符，Bea 担心会让宾客感到失望或困惑。为了负起责任并妥善处理这一情况，她觉得必须尽快到场，亲自说明变更的原因。
