# Camping!

Vikram and his wife, Priti, are camping. They’re sitting in their tent.

- **Priti**: I want to check my email …
- **Vikram**: We agreed not to use our phones during this trip, remember?
- **Priti**: You’re right. We should **enjoy nature**.
- **Vikram**: Let’s make dinner now. I’m hungry!
- **Priti**: Uh… we only have two apples. We ate too much at lunch.
- **Vikram**: Oh no. And all the stores are closed.
  Maybe camping was a bad idea …

Suddenly, Vikram hears a noise outside.

- **Vikram**: Wait … did you hear that?
- **Priti**: No …
- **Vikram**: Maybe it’s a bear …
  Do bears like apples?!
- **Priti**: I’ll look **outside the tent**.
- **Vikram**: Be careful! What do you see?
- **Priti**: It’s so dark. I don’t see anything.
  Wait! I see something near that other tent!
- **Vikram**: What is it?
- **Priti**: It’s … a guy delivering a pizza?
- **Vikram**: Really?
- **Priti**: Yes, those other campers ordered a pizza!

Priti **takes out** her phone.

- **Vikram**: What are you doing? We agreed not to use our phones.
- **Priti**:
- **Vikram**: Actually …. order two!
