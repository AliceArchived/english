# Creepy Creature Catcher - B3

Junior's rate: $30/hour

ATTENTION PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED OF CREEPY CREATURES!

Are you afraid of the creepy creatures in the dark? Do you lose sleep wondering if they are in your home? If you listen to me, creepy creatures will not scare you again!

I can help!

Welcome to Junior's Creepy Creature Catching! I am not scared of anything because I like creepy things. I am the best person to help you. I can rescue you from the weirdest and scariest creatures. Whether it is a spider, a shadow that moves, or even a strange noise, I will catch it for you!

Here's a review from Mr. Williams, who had a problem with a bat:

"Junior came in and caught the bat in my attic. I got scared, but Junior wasn't afraid at all. He used a sleeping bag to catch it! It was like seeing a superhero in action."

And here's a review from Ms. Rivera, who was frightened by a ghost:

"I didn't want to face the ghost in my basement. Junior wasn't scared. He told me ghost stories, and made the ghost go away. It was a little weird, but I felt safer in my house afterward."

Don't let creepy creatures frighten you anymore. Junior is here to help!

Don't wait! Call me today!

I think Junior is really smart. His bravery is obvious so he can do the business to handle creepy things for people. My favorite thing is Junior using scary stories to get rid of **ghosts**, and it works.

> Corrections:

1. “so he can do the business” → 改为更自然的 “which is why he can run a business”
2. “to handle creepy things” → 增加连贯性为 “that handles creepy things for people”
3. “My favorite thing is Junior using...” → 改为完整句式 “My favorite part is that he uses...”
4. “and it works” → 为强调语气加上 “actually”
