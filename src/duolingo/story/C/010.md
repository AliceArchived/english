# Concerned Parents - B2

From: Oscar@duomail.co

To: artclassparents@duomail.co

Subject: Recent Concerns

Dear Concerned Parents,

I've recently received quite a few emails regarding what I'm teaching in my art class. Many parents are concerned that I'm turning their children into "**little snobs**." Perhaps that's true. Do I see this as a negative thing? Absolutely not.

Though I hear your concerns, I completely disagree. I think it's very important for every young artist to learn to appreciate high-quality things.

Ms. Newsom, you described your son's grocery list as "**extravagant**," but I couldn't disagree more.

It's inspiring that Marshall asked to have caviar instead of spaghetti — not enough children enjoy caviar! Let's encourage his interest in fine cuisine.

Mr. Alvarez, you've been complaining that Diego has been replacing his 5-year-old sister's crayon drawings in your house with prints of famous paintings.

While I understand your concerns, you should be applauding his high standards for art.

Finally, Mr. Lee, I'm sorry your son threw away his inexpensive **polyester** pyjamas and used your credit card to order silk ones.

But when he said it was an "emergency," I must agree —silk pyjamas are the only way to get quality sleep!

Sincerely,

Oscar

## Writing

### What do you think about Oscar's students' behavior? Why?

I think it is not a good habit. What we use for our daily life should meet ~~out~~ income, there are always better quality stuff, but if we can't afford them, then don't use them.

I think it is not a good habit. What we use for our daily life should meet **our** income; there are always better quality **items**, but if we can't afford them, then **we shouldn't** use them.

> Corrections:

1. "meet our income" should be
   - "**match** our income" or "**be within** our income".
2. "items" is correct, but it's better to specify "**higher-quality items**" for clarity.
3. "then we shouldn't use them" is grammatically fine but can be improved in tone.

I think it is not a good habit. What we use **in** our daily life should **match** our **income**; there are always **higher-quality items**, but if we can't afford them, then **we shouldn't** use them.
