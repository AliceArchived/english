# Cousins

Lily and her mom are standing outside Lily's aunt's house.

- **Mom**: Lily, please be nice to your cousin Jessica tonight. She's really excited to see you!
- **Lily**: I'm not excited to see Jessica.
- **Mom**: Why?! She's so smart, talented, and polite…
- **Lily**: I know. She's so annoying.
- **Mom**: Lily. We're going inside.

They walk into the house.

- **Lily**: Hi, Aunt Mindy. Hello, Jessica.
- **Jessica**: Hi, Lily!
- **Mindy**: How's school going, Lily? Jessica is taking an advanced science class. She's studying climate change.
- **Lily**: Great.
- **Mom**: Well, Lily is a drummer in a band.
- **Mindy**: Oh? Jessica is in the orchestra at her school. They're playing for the Queen of Spain next month.
- **Mom**: The Queen?
- **Mindy**: She also won several **trophies**. Jessica, why don't you show Lily your trophies?
- **Jessica**: Sure!
- **Lily**: Ugh. Fine.

Lily follows Jessica to her bedroom, and Jessica closes the door.

- **Jessica**: Come on, let's go.
  - We can climb down the balcony.
- **Lily**: What?!
- **Jessica**: We've got an hour before dinner! They won't know that we left. My neighbor is having a party, and his hip-hop group is performing.
- **Lily**: OK…

Later, at the party…

- **Lily**: Wow, Jessica. I did not expect you to be so cool.
- **Jessica**: I know.

Lily's phone rings. It's her mom.

- **Mom**: Lily, where are you? What did you do to Jessica?
- **Lily**: What did I do?

Jessica takes the phone.

- **Jessica**: Hello! It's Jessica. Lily and I are at a… classical music concert.
- **Mom**: Oh!
- **Jessica**: I'm teaching Lily about my favorite composer.
- **Mom**: You're such a good cousin, Jessica.
- **Jessica**: Aw, thanks!

Jessica gives the phone back to Lily.

- **Lily**: Hi, Mom. So I'm not in trouble?
- **Mom**: Of course not!
  - Lily, you could learn a lot from your cousin.
- **Lily**: Actually, I think you're right.

### Practice History

**In your opinion, will Lily and Jessica get along in the future? Why?**

In my opinion, I think Lily and Jessica will get along in the future. Jessica is so good at **balancing** her own hobbies and parents' **expectations** and Lily admires this talent. They both love pop music. They have a lot to share.

> Corrections:

1. “so good at balancing her own hobbies and parents' expectations” 中 “parents' expectations” 前建议加上 “her” 以保证完整性（her parents’ expectations）。
2. “this talent” 改为 “this ability” 更自然，因为这里说的是一种处理事情的能力，而不是天赋（talent 常用于音乐、艺术等天赋场景）。
3. “They have a lot to share.” 可以用 “so they’ll have a lot to share.” 连接前后句以增强流畅度。

I think they can get along well in the future. They have similar **hobbies** and their moms also want them to be close. And also Jessica can deal with adults very well; Lily **appreciates** this talent.

Yes, I think they can get along well. Jessica knows how to deal with personal hobby and parents' requirements. Lily can learn a lot from Jessica. And Lily likes Jessica too.

> Corrections:

1.  “get along well in the future” 是正确表达
2.  “And also”
    - → 累赘，建议保留其中一个：“Also” 或 “And”
3.  “this talent”
    - → 有点抽象，建议更具体地说 “this ability” 或 “the way she communicates”
4.  “deal with personal hobby”
    - → 用法不自然，应为 “balance her personal interests with her parents’ expectations”
5.  “And Lily likes Jessica too.”
    - → 太短略显生硬，可合并进上句更自然

Yes, I think **Lily and Jessica** can get along well in the future. They **share** similar hobbies, and both of their mothers **hope** they will become close. Jessica **is good at** communicating with adults, and Lily really **appreciates** that about her.

Also, Jessica knows how to **balance** her personal interests with her parents’ expectations, which is something Lily can **learn from**. Most importantly, Lily **genuinely** likes Jessica and seems to admire her maturity and the way she handles things. With time, I believe their friendship will grow stronger.

是的，我认为 Lily 和 Jessica 将来可以相处得很好。她们有相似的兴趣爱好，而且她们的妈妈们也希望她们能亲近起来。Jessica 很擅长和大人沟通，而 Lily 对此非常欣赏。

此外，Jessica 懂得在个人兴趣和父母期望之间取得平衡，这是 Lily 可以向她学习的地方。最重要的是，Lily 真心喜欢 Jessica，并且欣赏她的成熟和处事方式。我相信随着时间的推移，她们的友谊会越来越深。
