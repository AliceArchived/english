# Celebrating the Seventies - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

This week, our school is celebrating the seventies. Students and teachers wear clothes from that decade, and the music is playing everywhere.

Everyone seems happy and excited about experiencing this part of history.

I hate it. The seventies are old news. Why should we care? I wasn't there. And by the way, bell-bottom jeans and tie-dye shirts are not my style. I can't stand wearing them.

You know what else is bad? The music. Songs from the seventies are playing all day. They are too loud and happy. Everyone is smiling and dancing. I'd much rather listen to my favorite bands, but I can't hear them right now.

Each day, teachers tell us stories from the seventies. I was hoping to learn something new in class, but it's just old stories. Did you know that Grandpa invented this medicine? How does this help me with my future?

We need to stop celebrating the seventies. I think it's time to recognize that not everyone likes the past. The school should focus on the present, so I can finally put off wearing these ridiculous clothes and get back to my normal music.

## Sentences

- 顺便说一下，喇叭裤和扎染衬衫不是我的风格。
  - And by the way, **bell-bottom jeans** and **tie-dye shirts** are not my style.
- 学校应该专注于当下，这样我终于可以不穿这些荒唐的衣服，回到我平常听的音乐里。
  - The school should focus on the present, so I can finally **put off** wearing these ridiculous clothes and get back to my normal music.
- Lily says the seventies are outdated and unimportant.

Lily 的校报专栏

本周，我们学校正在庆祝“七十年代”主题周。学生和老师都穿着那个年代的服装，到处都在播放当时的音乐。

大家似乎都很开心，也很兴奋能体验历史的这一部分。

我讨厌这样。七十年代早就过时了。我们为什么要在意？那时候我还没出生呢。而且顺便说一下，喇叭裤和扎染衬衫根本不是我的风格。我真是受不了穿这种衣服。

你知道还有什么更糟糕的吗？就是音乐。学校整天都在放七十年代的歌，声音太大了，而且都太开心。我宁愿听我最喜欢的乐队，但现在根本听不到。

每天老师都会给我们讲七十年代的故事。我本来希望在课堂上学点新知识，可结果只是些老故事。你知道有个爷爷发明了这种药吗？这对我的未来有什么帮助吗？

我们应该停止庆祝七十年代了。我觉得该承认不是每个人都喜欢过去。学校应该把注意力放在现在，这样我终于可以不用穿这些荒唐的衣服了，也能重新听我的音乐了。

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**What do you think of Lily's opinion?**

I disagree with Lily, although I can **understand where she’s coming from**. Not everyone enjoys looking back at history, especially if it feels irrelevant to their daily life. However, in my opinion, understanding the past — even something as recent as the 1970s — is important. It helps us see **how far we’ve come**, appreciate cultural changes, and even learn from past mistakes. Celebrating the seventies is not just about old music or clothes — it’s about **connecting generations** through shared experiences.

虽然我能理解 Lily 的想法，但我并不同意她的观点。并不是每个人都喜欢回顾历史，尤其是当这些事情看起来与当下生活无关时。然而，在我看来，了解过去——哪怕是像 1970 年代这样并不遥远的时期——依然很重要。它可以帮助我们了解社会的发展，欣赏文化的变化，甚至从过去的错误中吸取教训。庆祝七十年代不仅仅是关于老音乐或老衣服，更是一种跨时代的情感连接。

I **respectfully disagree with** Lily’s opinion. While she may have her reasons, I believe history plays a vital role in helping us understand who we are and how society has evolved. In my opinion, as human beings, we need to be aware of past events in order to learn from our mistakes and make wiser choices in the future. Ignoring history could mean repeating it. That’s why I strongly believe historical knowledge is essential for progress.

我对 Lily 的观点表示不同意见。虽然她可能有她的理由，但我认为历史在帮助我们了解自己和社会发展过程方面起着至关重要的作用。在我看来，作为人类，我们需要了解过去的事件，以便从错误中吸取教训，并在未来做出更明智的决策。忽视历史可能会导致重蹈覆辙。因此，我坚信历史知识对于社会进步是必不可少的。

I don’t really agree with Lily. Personally, I believe people should be aware of their history — especially when it’s still **relatively recent.** Even if some parts of the past are **unpleasant**, it's important to understand them rather than ignore them.

我其实不同意 Lily 的观点。就我个人而言，我认为人们应该了解自己的历史 — 尤其是当那段历史离现在还不算太远时。即使有些过去并不令人愉快，我们也应该去理解，而不是选择忽视。

### Practice History

**What do you think of Lily's opinion?**

I agree/ Lily makes/ In my opinion

I disagree with Lily. she makes her point which I can understand, but in my opinion, people should know their past ~~expecially~~ not a very distant past.

> Corrections:

1. Capitalized "she" at the beginning of the second sentence.
2. Changed "her point which I can understand" → "a point which I can understand" for grammatical clarity and smoother phrasing.
3. Corrected "expecially" to "especially" (spelling error).

I disagree with Lily. **She** makes **a point** which I can understand, but in my opinion, people should know their past — **especially** when **it’s** not a very distant one.

我不同意 Lily 的观点。她的立场我能理解，但在我看来，人们应该了解自己的过去——尤其是并不遥远的过去。

I don't agree with Lily. Lily makes a point which I can't agree with. In my opinion, history is important for us, as **human beings**, we should **be** aware of our past, so we can deal with the future better. (~~a human being~~)

> Corrections:

1. Removed the comma splice: "as human beings, we should be aware..." → changed to two sentences or added a conjunction for clarity.
2. "So we can deal with the future better" is fine but could be slightly more formal with "so that."

I don't agree with Lily. Lily makes a point which I can't agree with. In my opinion, history is important for us. As human beings, we should be aware of our past so that we can deal with the future better.

我不同意 Lily 的观点。Lily 提出的观点我无法认同。在我看来，历史对我们来说很重要。作为人类，我们应该了解自己的过去，这样才能更好地应对未来。

I don't agree with Lily. In my opinion, people should know their past, especially **if** it is not a **faraway** past. One **may not** like certain history, but again, they should know it.

> Corrections:

1. “especially if it is not a faraway past” → 更自然表达为 “especially if **it’s not too distant**”
2. “One may not like certain history” → 改为 “**certain parts of history**” 更准确
3. “but again, they should know it” → 改为 “they should **still be aware of** it” 更正式、逻辑更连贯•

I don't agree with Lily. In my opinion, people should know their past — especially if it’s not too distant. Someone may not like certain parts of history, but they should still be aware of it.

我不同意 Lily 的看法。在我看来，人们应该了解自己的过去 — 尤其是如果那段历史并不久远。有些历史你可能不喜欢，但你仍然应该知道它。
