# Celebrating the Seventies - B3

Lily's School Newspaper Column

This week, our school is celebrating the seventies. Students and teachers wear clothes from that decade, and the music is playing everywhere.

Everyone seems happy and excited about experiencing this part of history.

I hate it. The seventies are old news. Why should we care? I wasn't there. And by the way, bell-bottom jeans and tie-dye shirts are not my style. I can't stand wearing them.

You know what else is bad? The music. Songs from the seventies are playing all day. They are too loud and happy. Everyone is smilling and dancing. I'd much rather listen to my favorite bands, but I can't hear them right now.

Each day, teachers tell us stories from the seventies. I was hoping to learn something new in class, but it's just old stories. Did you know that Grandpa invented this medicine? How does this help me with my future?

We need to stop celebrating the seventies. I think it's time to recognize that not everyone likes the past. The school should focus on the present, so I can finally put off wearing these ridiculous clothes and get back to my normal music.

## Sentences

- 顺便说一下，喇叭裤和扎染衬衫不是我的风格。
  - And by the way, **bell-bottom jeans** and **tie-dye shirts** are not my style.
- 学校应该专注于当下，这样我终于可以不穿这些荒唐的衣服，回到我平常听的音乐里。
  - The school should focus on the present, so I can finally **put off** wearing these ridiculous clothes and get back to my normal music.
- Lily says the seventies are outdated and unimportant.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**What do you think of Lily's opinion?**

I don’t really agree with Lily. Personally, I believe people should be aware of their history — especially when it’s still **relatively recent.** Even if some parts of the past are **unpleasant**, it's important to understand them rather than ignore them.

我其实不同意 Lily 的观点。就我个人而言，我认为人们应该了解自己的历史 — 尤其是当那段历史离现在还不算太远时。即使有些过去并不令人愉快，我们也应该去理解，而不是选择忽视。

### Practice History

**What do you think of Lily's opinion?**

I agree/ Lily makes/ In my opinion

I don't agree with Lily. In my opinion, people should know their past, especially **if** it is not a **faraway** past. One **may not** like certain history, but again, they should know it.

> Corrections:

1. “especially if it is not a faraway past” → 更自然表达为 “especially if **it’s not too distant**”
2. “One may not like certain history” → 改为 “**certain parts of history**” 更准确
3. “but again, they should know it” → 改为 “they should **still be aware of** it” 更正式、逻辑更连贯•

I don't agree with Lily. In my opinion, people should know their past — especially if it’s not too distant. Someone may not like certain parts of history, but they should still be aware of it.

我不同意 Lily 的看法。在我看来，人们应该了解自己的过去 — 尤其是如果那段历史并不久远。有些历史你可能不喜欢，但你仍然应该知道它。
