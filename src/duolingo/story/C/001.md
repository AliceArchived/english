# Car Windows Closed - B3

From: bea@duomail.co

To: sam@duomail.co

---

**Subject: Windows Up!**

Hi Sam,

It's Bea, your friendly neighbor. I saw your black car parked by the sidewalk yesterday. The windows were all rolled down.

I know you might not have noticed, but there are lots of birds in our neighborhood. And lots of colorful leaves are falling right now. Imagine all of them getting inside your car. What a nightmare!

So, I took the liberty of rolling up your windows. I hate to think of all the leaves and birds that might have gotten in otherwise. Now your seats are safe!

By the way, it seems like your windshield hasn't been cleaned in ages. Maybe you should take it to the car wash soon. Just a friendly suggestion! Your car will thank you for it.

You're welcome!

Love,

Bea

### Practice History

**How would you feel about Bea's help?**

I would feel/ In my opinion, / Bea's actions

I would feel warm if someone **did** the same things as Bea did to me. In my opinion, Bea's action is very nice, she cares **for** people around her, and she likes to help people too.

> Corrections:

1. "action is" → "actions are" (subject–verb agreement; "actions" is plural)
2. "did to me" → "did for me" (idiomatic usage; “help” is usually done for someone)
3. "very nice" → "very kind" (more natural and formal in this context)
4. Added em dash with spacing as you prefer: " — "
5. "she likes to help people too" → rephrased as "enjoys helping others" for better fluency and tone.

I would feel warm if someone did the same things as Bea did for me. In my opinion, Bea's **actions** are very **kind** — she cares **about** the people around her and **enjoys helping others**.
