# Cemetery Photography - B3

Bea and Eddy are walking through a quiet cemetery. Bea has a camera and a notebook in hand. Eddy is eating chips.

- **Bea**: Eddy, I've started a new service! I help people reconnect with loved ones.
- **Eddy**: Huh? How do you do that?
- **Bea**: With photographs! I create **revealing, dramatic photo sessions** in cemeteries.
- **Eddy**: Oh. That sounds… **spooky**.
- **Bea**: No, it's artistic. Imagine the sun setting behind a **gravestone**. Or flowers blowing in the wind.
- **Eddy**: And this helps how?
- **Bea**: People will feel closer to their loved ones. It's emotional.

Eddy looks at a gravestone nearby and snaps a quick photo on his phone.

- **Eddy**: Look, Bea! I just took a random shot. It's kind of cool, right?
- **Bea**: That's not how it works, Eddy. These photos need to be planned, special, and deep.
- **Eddy**: I don't know. This one looks nice.

Eddy posts his photo online. His phone starts getting notifications immediately.

- **Eddy**: Whoa! People love this pic! Look at all these likes.
- **Bea**: What? Let me see that!

Bea looks at the photos. It's a blurry shot of a gravestone with Eddy's shadow in it.

- **Bea**: Eddy, your shadow is in the photo! And you're eating chips!
- **Eddy**: Yeah, but people love "the vibe," I guess.
- **Bea**: Nobody appreciates true art anymore.
- **Eddy**: Want me to post one of your fancy photos?
- **Bea**: No. I'd rather bury my camera.

墓地摄影

Bea 和 Eddy 正走在一个安静的墓地里。Bea 手里拿着相机和笔记本，Eddy 正在吃薯片。

- **Eddy**：
- **Bea**：Eddy，我开始了一项新服务！我帮人们重新与亲人建立联系。
- **Eddy**：哈？你怎么做到的？
- **Bea**：通过摄影！我在墓地里拍摄富有表现力、充满戏剧感的照片。
- **Eddy**：哦。听起来……有点吓人。
- **Bea**：不，这是艺术。想象一下夕阳洒在墓碑后面，或者微风中摇曳的花朵。
- **Eddy**：这有什么帮助呢？
- **Bea**：人们会感觉与他们所爱的人更加亲近。这是很感人的。

Eddy 看着附近一块墓碑，用手机随手拍了一张照片。

- **Eddy**：看，Bea！我刚随便拍了一张。还挺酷的吧？
- **Bea**：Eddy，摄影不是这么拍的。这些照片需要经过规划，要特别、有深度。
- **Eddy**：我不知道啊。但这张看起来挺好看的。

Eddy 把照片发到了网上。他的手机立刻开始收到通知。

- **Eddy**：哇！大家都喜欢这张照片！你看这些点赞数！
- **Bea**：什么？让我看看！

Bea 看着照片。那是一张模糊的墓碑照片，还拍到了 Eddy 的影子。

- **Bea**：Eddy，你的影子拍进去了！而且你还在吃薯片！
- **Eddy**：对啊，但大家好像就喜欢这种“氛围”吧。
- **Bea**：现在没人欣赏真正的艺术了。
- **Eddy**：你想让我发一张你那些精致的照片吗？
- **Bea**：不了。我宁愿把我的相机埋了。
