# Checking In

Bea runs through the airport. She is carrying a heavy suitcase and trying to get through the crowd.

- **Bea**: Excuse me! Sorry, I'm late!

Bea arrives at the **check-in desk**.

- **Bea**: Hello! Can I still check in for my flight?
- **Man**: Maybe. Where are you going?
- **Bea**: Hawaii! I'm so excited! My friends are getting married!
- **Man**: That's wonderful. You have fifteen minutes. You can still get on the flight.
- **Bea**: Great! Whew, I'm not usually late!
  - I just have to check this bag.
- **Man**: I'm sorry. It's too late to check your bag.
- **Bea**: What? You just said I can still get on my flight!
- **Man**: You can. But not your bag.
- **Bea**: But I need to be on this flight!
- **Man**: Sorry. Those are the rules.
- **Bea**: Ugh! I can't miss this wedding!
- **Man**: Maybe your friends will take some good pictures.

Bea takes a deep breath. Then she gets an idea.

- **Bea**: If I can't check a bag, then I won't check a bag.
- **Man**: Finally, you understand.

Bea opens up her suitcase.

- **Man**: Excuse me, ma'am?

Bea puts on a swimsuit over her outfit. Then she puts on another one.

- **Bea**: Ugh, why did I pack so many swimsuits?!
- **Man**: What are you doing?
- **Bea**: I'm going to wear all of my clothes on the plane.
  - There are no rules about that, right?

Next, Bea puts on two shirts, a pair of jeans, a formal dress, and an enormous hat. Her suitcase is now empty.

- **Man**: You still can't take that suitcase on the plane.
- **Bea**: It's OK. You can keep it.
- **Man**: Is there anything else I can help you with?
- **Bea**: Can you get me a ride to the gate? I can't move.

**Why couldn't Bea check her bag?**

Bea couldn't / too late / check her

Bea couldn’t check her bag because she **arrived** at the **airport** too late. She checked in only 15 minutes before the flight **was scheduled to depart**, **which** wasn’t enough time for the airline to **process** her luggage. As a result, they let her **board** the plane, but her suitcase had to **stay behind**. To solve this problem, Bea cleverly put on all the **clothes** from her suitcase and left the **now-empty bag** at the airport. That was a smart and creative solution.

Bea 没能托运行李，因为她到机场时太晚了。她在航班预定起飞前 15 分钟才办理登机手续，航空公司已经来不及处理她的行李。于是他们让她登机，但她的行李只能留在机场。为了解决这个问题，Bea 机智地把箱子里的所有衣服都穿在身上，然后把空箱子留在了机场。这真是一个聪明又有创意的做法。

**Bea packed a lot of clothes! In your opinion, what is better, traveling light or traveling with many things? Why?**

Personally, I prefer traveling with more things. I find it more comfortable to have everything I might need, especially when it comes to clothes or **personal items**. If I **pack too lightly**, I often feel unprepared or uncomfortable. Honestly, if I can’t bring what I need, I’d rather not travel at all.

就我个人而言，我更喜欢带多一点东西去旅行。我觉得这样更舒服，特别是当涉及到衣物或个人用品时。如果我带得太少，往往会感到不方便或不安心。说实话，如果不能带上需要的东西，我宁愿不去旅行。

### Practice History

**Why couldn't Bea check her bag?**

Bea couldn't / too late / check her

Bea couldn't check her bag because she checked in too late. It was only 15 minutes before the flight's departure. With the limited time, the ~~airplane~~ only ~~allow~~ her to check in, but not her suitcase.

> Corrections:

1. “With the limited time, the airplane only allow her to check in...”
   1. ❌ “airplane” → should be “airline”
   2. ❌ “allow” → should be past tense “allowed”
   3. ❌ Repetitive structure — can be made more fluent.

Bea couldn’t check her bag because she checked in too late—only 15 minutes before the flight’s departure. Due to the limited time, the **airline** **allowed** her to check in, but not her suitcase.

**Bea packed a lot of clothes! In your opinion, what is better, traveling light or traveling with many things? Why?**

I prefer to **travel** with many things. It's more comfortable. If I take little things I'd rather not travel.

- 如果我带的东西太少，我宁愿不旅行。
  - "If I take little things I'd rather not travel."
  - This sentence is awkward and unclear. It likely intends to say:
    **"If I bring too few things, I’d rather not travel."**

I prefer to **travel** with many things. It's more comfortable. If I bring too few things, I’d rather not travel.

> Corrections:

1. “travel with many things” → grammatically okay, but "travel with more things" or "pack more" sounds more natural
2. “too few things” → correct, but can be more fluently expressed
3. “I’d rather not travel.” → good idea, but needs more context or tone to sound complete

I prefer **to travel** with **more** things. It’s **more** comfortable. If **I don’t bring enough**, I’d rather not travel at all.
