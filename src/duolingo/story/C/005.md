# Cat Sitting - B2

Bea arrives at her friend Lin's apartment with a cat.

- **Bea**: Thanks for watching my roommate's cat, Potato, while I'm on my business trip.
- **Lin**: Is it too late to change my mind?
- **Bea**: Yes. And remember not to leave him alone. Otherwise, he'll get into trouble.
- **Lin**: But I'm working on my **memoir** this weekend.
- **Bea**: Lin, we both know you're going to watch a **Motorcycle Warriors** marathon instead.

Lin groans. Bea leaves as Potato takes Lin's **spot** on the couch.

- **Lin**: That's my spot!

As Lin tries to move Potato, he jumps up and knocks over a sculpture.

- **Lin**: That's my grandma's favorite sculpture. Her friend Pablo made it!

As Lin tries to glue the sculpture back together, Potato knocks over Lin's bowl of popcorn.

- **Lin**: Potato, you're so annoying.

As Lin cleans up the popcorn, Potato steps on the TV remote, changing the channel.

- **Lin**: Potato, no! They're about to declare a winner!

Frightened, Potato runs away and **trips over** the TV **cord**, which knocks the TV over.

- **Lin**: Ugh, unbelievable! That's it. We're not friends anymore, Potato!

Lin calls Bea and leaves a voicemail.

- **Lin**: Potato broke the TV! You need to come back now, or I'm getting someone else to watch him!

The next day, Bea returns. She finds Lin and Potato happily napping together next to Lin's laptop.

- **Bea**: Lin! I canceled the rest of my trip, and now you like Potato?!
- **Lin**: After the TV broke, I had to start working on my memoir. I wrote a lot since Potato wouldn't let me go anywhere.

Potato **rolls onto** Lin's keyboard and presses the delete key. Suddenly, Lin's screen goes blank.

- **Lin**: Potato, no! You deleted everything I wrote!

## Speaking

Do you think Lin want to watch Potato again in the future? Why or why not?

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7+

I don’t think Lin will want to take care of Potato again in the future. He caused a lot of trouble — he broke valuable things and even deleted her memoir. Although they ended up getting along, I believe the experience was too frustrating for her to repeat.

我认为 Lin 将来不会再想照顾 Potato 了。他惹出了很多麻烦——不仅弄坏了贵重物品，甚至还删掉了她的回忆录。虽然他们最后相处得不错，但这段经历对她来说可能太糟糕，不值得再来一次。

I don’t think Lin **would** want to take care of Potato again. He destroyed several things in her home and even deleted her memoir, which was very important to her. After going through such a **frustrating experience**, it’s unlikely she’d want to deal with him again in the future.

我认为 Lin 不会想再照顾 Potato 了。他破坏了她家里的很多东西，甚至删掉了她非常重要的回忆录。在经历了这么糟糕的一次经历后，她将来应该不会再愿意和他打交道了。

I believe Lin would be **reluctant** to see Potato again in the future. Although Potato was initially **endearing**, his behavior turned **destructive** — he broke several items in Lin's home and even damaged her cherished memoir. Such actions likely left Lin feeling frustrated and disappointed. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that she wouldn't want to interact with Potato again.

我认为林将来不太愿意见到土豆。虽然土豆起初很讨人喜欢，但他的行为变得具有破坏性——他打破了林家中的几样物品，甚至毁坏了她珍贵的回忆录。这些行为很可能让林感到沮丧和失望。因此，可以合理地推断，她不想再与土豆接触。

### Practice

I think Lin will not want to see Potato again. Potato **destroyed** a lot of things and even destroyed Lin's **memoir**.
