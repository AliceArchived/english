# Call a Doctor!

Eddy is jogging in the neighborhood. Suddenly, he falls and hurts his ankle.

- **Eddy**: Ow!

A man in a **white lab coat** walks quickly past him.

- **Eddy**: Hey! Doctor! Doctor!
- **Man**: Who, me?
- **Eddy**: Yes, can you help me?
- **Man**: I'm actually late. I need to go to work.
- **Eddy**: But my ankle hurts a lot. Please help me!
- **Man**: Well ... OK.
  - I'll just take off your shoe ...
  - Wow! This looks bad!
- **Eddy**: Oh no. What's wrong?
- **Man**: You really need to **cut** your **toenails**!
  - But let me look at your ankle. Hm. I'm going to try to move it.
- **Eddy**: What? No - Ow?
- **Man**: OK, that was a bad idea. Did it hurt?
- **Eddy**: Yes!
- **Man**: Oops. Hmm. Maybe I can make a bandage.

He tears a piece of Eddy's shirt.

- **Eddy**: Hey! My shirt!
- **Man**: I need it to make a bandage. I'm going to put it around your ankle.
- **Eddy**: Ow! That's too tight!
- **Man**: If you're going to complain about everything, I'm not going to help you.
- **Eddy**: What? Don't doctors have to help people when they're hurt?
- **Man**: I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
- **Eddy**: You said you were a doctor.
- **Man**: No, I didn't. I'm an actor.
- **Eddy**: Why are you wearing a lab coat?
- **Man**: I'm a doctor on a TV show, and I'm wearing my costume.
- **Eddy**: Wait, I've seen you on the TV show you're on! My son and I watch it!
  - I know how you can help me feel better...
- **Man**: How?
- **Eddy**: You can take a picture with me for my son!
