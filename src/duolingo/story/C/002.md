# Cake Delivery - B2

Vikram and his friend, Eddy, are driving in the countryside.

- **Vikram**: Thanks for coming to deliver this cake I baked for my cousin's wedding!
- **Eddy**: I love weddings! There's always good food, and I'm starving!

Suddenly, they hear a loud noise coming from Vikram's car.
Vikram drives to the side of the road and gets out.

- **Vikram**: Oh no! We have a **flat tire**.
- **Eddy**: What?! Now it'll be hours before I can eat!
- **Vikram**: More importantly, we need to deliver this cake or the wedding will be ruined!
- **Eddy**: Let's call Lin's Towing Service!

Eddy calls a number.

- **Lin**: Hi, **you've reached** Lin's Towing Service. I hope your call isn't urgent because I've got other stuff to do. Call me back later!
- **Vikram**: It's 5 p.m. Of course she didn't answer! Her favourite reality show is on.
- **Eddy**: What are we going to do? We could be stuck here for days!
- **Vikram**: We need to stay calm.
- **Eddy**: But we don't have any food!
- **Vikram**: I have an idea. I'll watch a video about how to change the tire!
- **Eddy**: And I'll find food! There are berries in those bushes over there. We can eat those!

Eddy runs to pick some berries from the bushes and tries one.

- **Vikram**: Eddy, those are **poisonous**!

Eddy spits out the berry.

- **Eddy**: Ugh, I'm so hungry. I'm going to faint ....
- **Vikram**: Eddy, why don't you rest while I change this tire?

Vikram starts working on the car.

An hour later, Vikram is feeling **frustrated**.

- **Vikram**: This is pointless! I'm trying to use this **jack** to lift the car, but it won't work.

Eddy suddenly runs over and helps lift the car.

- **Eddy**: Don't worry! I just got a lot of energy!
- **Vikram**: You lifted the car! Now we can change the tire and go to the wedding. And you won't starve!
- **Eddy**: Oh. Yeah ...
- **Vikram**: Wait ... what's all over your face? Is that **frosting**?
- **Eddy**: Uhh ... How long will it take to bake another cake?

## Writing

### How do you think Vikram feels about Eddy now? Explain your answer.

I think Vikram must think Eddy is quite annoying now. Their main target is to deliver the cake, and Eddy has already eaten it. (~~eatten~~)

> Corrections:

1. **“main target”**
   - → 虽然不是错，但在这个语境中，**“goal”** 或 **“purpose”** 更自然
2. 时态统一建议：前面用了 “was to deliver”，后面应保持完成时的一致性

I think Vikram must think Eddy is quite annoying now. Their main **goal** was to deliver the cake, and Eddy has already eaten it.

我觉得 Vikram 现在一定觉得 Eddy 很烦。他们的主要目标是把蛋糕送过去，但 Eddy 已经吃掉了。

---

I think Vikram must very upset with Eddy because Eddy ate the wedding cake. And the cake delivery is their main purpose for this trip.

> Corrections:

1. “must very upset”
   - 缺少 be 动词；**must** 后面应接动词原形或 “be”
   - 改为：“must **be** very upset”
2. “because Eddy ate the wedding cake”
   - 语法上没错，但可以稍作扩展，让句意更完整，例如：“because Eddy ate the wedding cake **they were supposed to deliver”**
3. “And the cake delivery **is** their main purpose for this trip.”
   - 用时态不一致。“is” 应改为 **“was”**（描述过去发生的事）
   - 更自然表达为：**“delivering the cake was the main reason for their trip”**

I think Vikram must be very upset with Eddy because Eddy ate the wedding cake they were supposed to deliver. Delivering the cake was the main reason for their trip, so Eddy completely ruined it.

我认为 Vikram 一定对 Eddy 非常生气，因为 Eddy 吃掉了他们本来要送去的结婚蛋糕。而这趟旅行的主要目的就是送蛋糕，所以 Eddy 等于把整个任务搞砸了。

### Polished

I think Vikram feels **frustrated** and **disappointed** with Eddy. At first, Eddy complained about being hungry and even tried to eat poisonous berries. Then, even though Vikram worked hard to fix the car, Eddy secretly ate the wedding cake they were supposed to deliver. That was the **whole point of the trip**, so Vikram must be upset that Eddy ruined it.

我认为 Vikram 对 Eddy 感到很沮丧和失望。刚开始 Eddy 就一直抱怨饿了，甚至还试着吃有毒的浆果。后来，尽管 Vikram 一直在努力修车，Eddy 却偷偷把他们要送去婚礼的蛋糕吃掉了。而他们这趟旅行的主要任务就是送这块蛋糕，所以 Vikram 一定很生气，觉得 Eddy 把事情搞砸了。

> Corrections:

1. Vikram must be very upset with Eddy.
   - 这是**完全正确**的表达，"upset" 是一个广义的情绪词，意思是“不高兴、生气、难过、沮丧……”，但**它的意思太宽泛了**。
2. Vikram feels frustrated and disappointed with Eddy.
   - 这样做的目的是**更具体地表达 Vikram 的情绪状态**，让读者更容易理解他为什么不高兴。

为什么用过去时 ‘Vikram felt frustrated and disappointed’，而不是现在时 ‘Vikram feels…’？有没有更好的时态表达？

1. **因为故事已经发生了**
   1. 原始文本是讲述过去发生的事件（Vikram 和 Eddy 去送蛋糕的过程），所以你对 Vikram 情绪的分析也是**基于过去的情节**。
   2. Vikram worked hard to fix the car, **but** Eddy ate the cake.
      → 所以 **Vikram felt frustrated and disappointed**.
   3. 用过去时能保持**叙述时态一致性**。
2. 用现在时（feels）也对，但语气更“概括化”
   1. 如果你说：**“Vikram feels frustrated and disappointed.”**
      也对，但听起来更像是在讲一个**持续的事实**，而不是基于一个已结束的事件。
   2. 所以它听起来更像：
      “Vikram **现在仍然**很失望。”
      但故事已经结束，我们并不知道他“现在”是不是还生气。
3. 有没有更好的选择？
   1. 如果你想**结合故事背景，又想让语言更生动**，可以使用：
      1. **“must have felt”**（表示过去推测）
      2. **Vikram must have felt frustrated and disappointed after Eddy ate the cake.**
         （Eddy 吃了蛋糕之后，Vikram 一定觉得又沮丧又失望。）
      3. 样更强调你是**根据线索推测**他的情绪，非常自然、正式、适合写作。
