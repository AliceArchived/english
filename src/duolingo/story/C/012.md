# Cousin Lou - B2

Lin is napping on the couch when Lucy enters with Lin's cousin, Lou. He's carrying a suitcase.

- **Lou**: Thanks for letting me stay here this weekend. Where's your bathroom?
- **Lucy**: It's down the hall.
- **Lin**: Why is Lou staying here? I was planning on spending the weekend watching the last few episodes of "Chef Island"! I can't wait to see who wins.
- **Lucy**: Too bad. He's staying on the couch.
- **Lin**: But this is my couch.
- **Lucy**: Yes, he'll be sleeping on the couch and eating all your food. You'll finally know what it's like to live with someone like you!
- **Lin**: Are you trying to teach me a lesson?
- **Lucy**: Definitely.

Lou drops his suitcase on the couch and opens the fridge.

- **Lucy**: Help yourself to some ice cream, Lou.
- **Lin**: Hey, that's my dinner!
- **Lucy**: Let him have it! He's our guest.

Lou grabs **a container of ice cream** and sits next to Lin.

- **Lucy**: Get comfortable, Lou. Take off your shoes!

Lin puts "Chef Island" on the TV as Lou kicks off his shoes.

- **Lou**: This is my favorite show!
- **Lin**: Really? Mine too! I've been avoiding **spoilers** about the winner all week!
- **Lou**: Lucy, could you make us some snacks?
- **Lin**: Whoa, I was just going to say that! You're actually kind of cool, Lou.
- **Lucy**: You're both old enough to make your own snacks.
- **Lin**: But Lou is our guest! We should make him feel comfortable.

Annoyed, Lucy throws a bag of chips at Lin's head. Lin catches it.

- **Lin**: It looks like your lesson failed, Grandma.
- **Lou**: I loved this season! Can you believe Hasan lost for lying about his **spaghetti** recipe and Sarah won?!
- **Lin**: Sarah won?! Lou, you spoiled my favorite show!
- **Lucy**: I guess you've learned your lesson after all.

**If you were Lucy, how would you teach Lin a lesson? What would you do differently?**

If I were Lucy, I think I would probably respond in a similar way. In many cases, simply talking to someone isn’t enough to make them realize their mistakes. **People tend to learn best from personal experiences** — when they face the consequences of their actions, they’re more likely to reflect and truly understand what needs to change. I believe **Lucy’s approach**, while a bit indirect, was effective because it gave Lin the chance to learn from the situation herself.

如果我是露西，我想我可能也会采取类似的做法。在很多情况下，单纯与某人交谈并不足以让他们意识到自己的错误。人们往往通过亲身经历来获得最深刻的教训 —— 当他们面对自己行为的后果时，才更有可能反思并真正明白需要改变的地方。我认为露西的方法虽然有些间接，但很有效，因为它让林有机会从事件中自己学到教训。

**Why does Lucy let Lou stay on the couch?**

Lucy allows Lou to stay on the couch **as a way to teach Lin a lesson** — to help her realize just how frustrating it can be to live with someone who behaves like she does.

Lucy 让 Lou 睡在沙发上，是想借此教 Lin 一课 — 让她意识到和一个像她那样的人一起生活会有多令人烦恼。

### Practice History

**Why does Lucy let Lou stay on the couch?**

Lucy lets/ to teach/ Lin to

Lucy lets Lou stay on the couch to teach Lin a lesson so she can realize how annoying to live with someone like Lin herself.

> Corrections:

1. “how annoying to live...” → 应为 “how annoying it is to live...” 缺少形式主语 it
2. “like Lin herself” → 更自然写法为 “like herself”（避免重复“Lin”，上下文已经清楚）

Lucy lets Lou stay on the couch to teach Lin a lesson — so Lin can realize how annoying **it is** to live with someone **like herself**.

Lucy 让 Lou 睡沙发，是为了给 Lin 上一课 — 让她意识到，和像她这样的人一起住是多么烦人。

**If you were Lucy, how would you teach Lin a lesson? What would you do differently?**

If I were Lucy, I **would** probably do the same thing. **Talking** with a person is not a good idea; one needs to experience something, then they can think about it, **and** after that, they may figure out if they need to change.

> Corrections:

1. “Talking with a person” → “Talking to someone” is more natural in this context.
2. Added “is not always effective” for clarity.
3. Slight restructuring for fluency and logic — especially “then they can think about it, and after that...” changed to a more natural flow.

If I were Lucy, I would probably do the same thing. Talking to someone is not always effective — people often need to **go through something themselves** to **reflect and realize** whether they need to change.

如果我是露西，我可能也会做同样的事。和别人谈话不总是有效的 —— 人们往往需要亲身经历一些事情，才能反思并意识到自己是否需要改变。
