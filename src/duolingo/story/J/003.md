# Junior Makes a Mess

Eddy comes home from work.

- **Eddy**: Junior! I'm home!
- **Junior**: I'm in my room, Dad!

Eddy goes to Junior's room. There is paint everywhere.

- **Eddy**: Junior! What are you doing? You made a mess!
- **Junior**: I know! I'm working on something special!
- **Eddy**: Ugh, Junior. We need to clean this room.
- **Junior**: OK, Dad…
- **Eddy**: But let's make dinner first.

Eddy and Junior walk to the kitchen. There's paint and chocolate everywhere.

- **Eddy**: Junior! What did you do?!
  - Why is there paint in here too? And what is this on the walls? Chocolate? How did you get chocolate on the walls?
- **Junior**: I was baking! It was **messy**.
- **Eddy**: Junior, please help me clean now.
- **Junior**: But, Dad…
- **Eddy**: I had a difficult day. No one at work remembered my birthday.
  - I just wanted to come home and have a nice dinner with my son. But now we have to clean your room and the kitchen!
- **Junior**: Dad…
- **Eddy**: I have a headache. I'm going to lie down on the couch.

Eddy goes to the living room. Junior runs behind him.

- **Junior**: Wait, Dad —
- **Eddy**: Junior! There's paint and chocolate in here too! You're in trouble now!
  - Wait… is that a birthday cake?
- **Junior**: Yes!
- **Eddy**: And is that a painting of… a clown?
- **Junior**: No, that's a painting of you. Happy birthday, Dad!
- **Eddy**: Oh. Thank you for **remembering**, Junior. I love it.

Eddy hugs Junior.

- **Junior**: Do you want to eat some cake now?
- **Eddy**: Uh… maybe later, Junior. This cake is covered in paint…

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Junior tried to arrange a special birthday for Eddy. How do you celebrate your birthday normally?**

Honestly, I don’t usually celebrate my birthday. In fact, **there have been times** when I didn’t even realize my birthday had passed until a few days later. **Celebrating** it has never been part of my routine. I remember one time in high school, a classmate asked me when my birthday was — and I had no idea. I actually had to go home and ask my mom!

说实话，我平时不过生日。其实有几次，我甚至在生日过了几天之后才意识到。庆祝生日从来不是我生活中的一部分。我记得有一次在高中，一个同学问我生日是哪天 —— 我居然完全不知道，最后还得回家问我妈！

**Why did Eddy lie down on the couch?**

Eddy lay down on the couch because he was feeling emotionally **drained** after a tough day at work. What made things worse was that nobody at his workplace even acknowledged his birthday, which left him feeling sad and unappreciated. Lying on the couch was his way of coping with the disappointment and loneliness. It’s clear that he needed a moment to rest and recover from such a **disheartening** experience — one that should have been special but turned out to be overlooked.

Eddy 躺在沙发上，是因为他在工作中经历了一天的情绪压力。更糟糕的是，办公室里没有人记得他的生日，这让他感到非常失落和被忽视。他选择躺在沙发上，是为了应对这种失望和孤独。显然，他需要片刻的休息来缓解内心的打击 —— 原本应该是特别的一天，却被冷落了。

### Practice History

**Junior tried to arrange a special birthday for Eddy. How do you celebrate your birthday normally?**

Usually, I don't celebrate my birthday. A lot of times, after my birthday I only **realized that** **it** has just passed. I don't have the habit **of celebrating** my birthday. I still remember when my high school classmate asked me what date **was** my birthday, and I didn't know it. I went back home to ask my mom about it.

> Corrections:

1. "realized that it has just passed" → tense inconsistency. “realized” is past simple, so the second clause should match: “had just passed” or restructure the sentence.
2. “what date was my birthday” → unnatural word order in indirect questions; correct is “what date my birthday was.”

Usually, I don't celebrate my birthday. **Many times**, I only **realize** my birthday **has just passed** after the **fact**. I don’t really have the habit of celebrating it. I still remember **once** in high school, when a classmate asked me **when** my birthday was — and I didn’t even know. I had to go home and ask my mom about it.

我通常不过生日。很多时候，我是在生日过后才意识到它已经过去了。我没有庆祝生日的习惯。我还记得上高中时，有个同学问我生日是哪一天，我竟然不知道。最后我回家问了我妈妈。
