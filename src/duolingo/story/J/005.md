# Junior's Birthday Party

Eddy and his son, Junior, are tying balloons to their apartment building's front gate. Just then, Eddy's co-worker Oscar walks by.

- **Eddy**: Hey, Oscar! Want to help us get ready for Junior's birthday party?
- **Oscar**: No, thank you.
- **Eddy**: Junior is inviting all his friends from school. It's going to be fun!
- **Oscar**: Hmm. Isn't Leo Garmin's son in Junior's class? Leo owns the gallery where I want to show my work.
- **Junior**: You mean Josh Garmin? Yeah, but we're not friends.
- **Oscar**: If you invite Josh, I'll help you out with the party.
- **Junior**: Hmm … I'll do it if you agree to paint kids' faces.
- **Oscar**: I'm a real artist, not a children's entertainer. Absolutely not!
- **Junior**: OK, I guess I won't invite Josh then …

**Nevertheless**, several hours later at the party, Oscar **finds himself** painting Junior's face like a lion.

As Oscar finishes Junior's face, Josh and his father, Leo Garmin, look over at them.

- **Oscar**: Leo is coming this way! Show him the **cubist** masterpiece I painted on your face.
- **Junior**: But my friends are playing video games inside.
- **Oscar**: I'll buy you a new video game if you do it.
- **Junior**: Alright, I want Museum of Doom 2! My dad won't buy it for me. He says it's too scary.

Leo approaches Oscar and Junior.

- **Leo**: Junior, are you enjoying your birthday party?
- **Junior**: Yes, and look at my face! It's a cubist masterpiece - whatever that means. Thanks, Mr. Oscar!
- **Oscar**: Aw, that's so kind, Junior. Now, go and play with your friends while I talk to Mr. Garmin.
- **Junior**: Finally!

Junior runs away.

Later, Eddy and Junior notice Oscar sitting by himself, looking **discouraged**.

- **Eddy**: What's wrong, Oscar? I talked to Leo earlier, and he mentioned he wanted to hire you!
- **Oscar**: Yes, he wanted to hire me … to paint faces at his son's birthday party.

## Writing

### How do you think Oscar feels now? Why?

I believe that Oscar feels disappointed. **But** in my opinion, he doesn't need to feel that way. Actually, it's a good opportunity. If he can get familiar with the family, he will get the chance to show his art in the **gallery**.

> - "Actually, it's a good opportunity." → grammatically fine, but “In fact” might sound a bit smoother in formal writing.
> - “get familiar with the family” → should be “**become** familiar with the family” or “**get to know** the family.”
> - “show his art in the **gallery**” is okay, but you could also say “have a chance to exhibit his art in the gallery” for clarity and precision.
