# Junior's First Kiss

Junior's classmate Olivia is leaving her house when she sees Junior walking a group of dogs. He's wearing what he thinks is his most impressive outfit — a suit and bow tie.

- **Olivia**: Junior! What are you wearing? You look like you're going to a wedding.
- **Junior**: Oh, hi, Olivia! I just like dressing up.

Junior actually wanted to look his best because he knew he'd be walking past Olivia's house.

- **Olivia**: Do you own all these dogs?
- **Junior**: No, I started a successful dog-walking business after my dad refused to let me get my own dog.

In fact, Junior had begun his dog-walking business **solely** to impress Olivia, since he knew she loved dogs.

- **Olivia**: Wow, you're so ambitious!
- **Junior**: I know. I'm basically a millionaire now, so I can afford ice cream… for two!

Junior **winks**.

- **Olivia**: Why are you winking at me?
- **Junior**: Because… I was wondering… can I take you to get ice cream sometime? I know you're dating Andy but…
- **Olivia**: I'm not dating Andy! I just like his dog.
- **Junior**: Oh really? So do you want to go on a walk with me and the dogs right now?
- **Olivia**: Well, I'm very busy… but I guess I can spare fifteen minutes for dogs.

The dogs drag Junior down the street as Olivia follows.

- **Junior**: So could I meet your parents sometime soon? I would like to introduce myself.
- **Olivia**: What?
- **Junior**: Well, I'm your boyfriend now, right? Should I meet them before or after our first ice cream date?
- **Olivia**: Junior, we're eight! I don't want a boyfriend until I'm at least twelve.
- **Junior**: Twelve? That's so old!
- **Olivia**: I know, but I need to travel the world, and publish my novel… and buy a house first!
- **Junior**: But the housing market is terrible right now!
- **Olivia**: Sorry, it's been fifteen minutes. I have to go.

Olivia leaves. Junior pulls his bow tie off and lies on the ground. One of the dogs starts licking his face.

- **Junior**: Thanks, buddy, but I imagined my first kiss would be with Olivia.

**What was your favorite part of the story? Why?**

My favorite **moment** in the story was definitely when the two kids were **dreaming about** their future together. Olivia especially impressed me because she had such ambitious goals, like wanting to write her own book and buy her own house someday. It **amused** me that she considered even 12 years old to be already **quite grown-up**. This part stood out because it vividly captured the innocent yet determined mindset children often have about **adulthood**, making the scene both **charming** and **relatable**.

我最喜欢这个故事的部分，毫无疑问是两个孩子一起畅想未来的时候。Olivia 尤其让我印象深刻，因为她有着非常远大的抱负，比如将来要写一本属于自己的书，还要买一栋自己的房子。更让我感到有趣的是，她甚至觉得 12 岁已经是个相当大的年龄了。这一段特别吸引我，因为它生动地表现了孩子们对长大成人的那种天真又坚定的想法，使得整个情节既可爱又令人产生共鸣。

My favorite part of the story was the moment when the two children started discussing their **future aspirations**. I found Olivia particularly fascinating because she expressed surprisingly **mature ambitions** for someone so young. She planned not only to write a book but also to buy her own house someday. What amused me most was her **innocent** yet **earnest** opinion that **turning** 12 years old was already too grown-up. This scene **resonated** deeply with me because it perfectly illustrated children's charming yet **exaggerated perceptions** of adulthood.

### Practice History

**What was your favorite part of the story? Why?**

I really liked **when** the two kids talked about their future. Olivia had a huge plan, she wanted to write a book and buy a house. **She** even thought 12 years old is too old.

> Corrections:

1. "when" → The sentence structure should be clearer by specifying "the part when."
2. "huge plan" → Usually "plans" is pluralized to show multiple ambitions clearly.
3. "She" → Better punctuation (using an em dash with spaces) enhances clarity and flow.
4. "is too old" → Verb tense agreement is needed: "was" aligns with past narration. The structure "thought being 12 years old was already too old" clarifies the meaning.

I really liked **the part** when the two kids talked about their future. Olivia had **big plans** — she wanted to write a book and buy a house. She even thought **being** 12 years old was **already** too old.

我最喜欢的部分是两个孩子讨论他们未来的时候。Olivia 有着宏伟的计划——她想写一本书，还想买一栋房子。她甚至觉得 12 岁都已经太老了。
