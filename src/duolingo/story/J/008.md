- **Junior**: Yes. My dad said you're going on a trip. So, I would like to apply for a job watering your plants.
- **Bea**: Ah! Please, sit down.
- **Junior**: Thank you, I will sit down.

He sits down and opens his **briefcase**.

- **Bea**: Would you like a cookie?
- **Junior**: No, thank you. I don't eat during business meetings.
- **Bea**: Good, because they're my roommate's cookies. She's not happy when I eat them.

Junior gives his resume to Bea.

- **Bea**: Did you write this with a **crayon**?

  - But first I'll have my own business. And you're my first customer.
- **Bea**: Watering plants is a very big job.
- **Junior**: You only have two plants. And they're dying.
- **Bea**: Right. My roommate and I always forget to water them.
- **Junior**: Bea. Listen.
- **Bea**: Yeah?
- **Junior**: If you give me the job, you can eat all of your roommate's cookies. And then, you can tell her I ate them.

**Why did Junior want the job?**

Junior wanted the job watering Bea’s plants because she was about to go on a business trip, and her plants weren’t **doing well** at all — they were dying.

Junior 想要这份给 Bea 浇花的工作，因为她快要出差了，而且她的植物状态很差——它们快死了。

#### Can we say “a plant is doing well”?

✅ Yes — absolutely natural and common!
👉 In English, “do well” is often used for people, animals, and also plants, businesses, etc. It means “to be healthy / to thrive / to succeed / to be in good condition.”

💡 Examples:

- My roses are doing really well this year.
- The plants in my garden aren’t doing well — I think they need more sunlight.
- Her business is doing well.

**Junior has many plans for the future! Could you tell us one of your goals for the future?**

One of my main goals for the future is to change my life for the better. **At the moment**, I’m focusing on **earning** some certifications so that I can get a job locally. After that, I hope to start a second career and create something truly meaningful for my future.

我未来的主要目标之一是让自己的生活变得更好。现在，我正专注于考取一些证书，这样我可以在本地找到工作。之后，我希望开始第二份职业，为自己的未来创造真正有意义的东西。

> 🌟 Speaking Band 8.0

One of my goals for the future is to find a job locally. However, it’s a **challenging** time to **enter** the job market. The **rise** of AI has made employment more competitive. Many large tech companies are **laying off** workers, **reducing hiring**, and the employees who’ve been laid off are now competing with me for the same positions.

我未来的目标之一是在本地找到一份工作。然而，现在求职的确非常困难。人工智能的崛起使就业市场竞争更加激烈。许多大型科技公司正在裁员、减少招聘，而被裁掉的员工也在与我竞争同样的职位。

### Practice History

**Why did Junior want the job?**

Junior wanted / start/ were dying

Junior wanted the job watering Bea's plants because Bea is going to start a business trip and her plants aren't in good **condition** — they were dying.

> Corrections:

1. “is going to start” → past context → better as was about to start (or was going to start)
2. Tense alignment: Since the story reflects a past situation, it’s clearer to keep past tense consistently.

Junior wanted the job watering Bea’s plants because Bea **was** about to start a business trip and her plants weren’t in good condition — they were dying.

Junior 想要这份给 Bea 浇花的工作，因为 Bea 要开始出差了，她的植物状况不太好——它们快要死了。

**Junior has many plans for the future! Could you tell us one of your goals for the future?**

> Corrections:

I want to find a job locally. It is a difficult time for job finding. Because of AI, the job market is **struggling**. Many big tech **companies** are **firing** employees, **hiring fewer** staff, and the **laid-off** employees **are competing with me in** the market.

> Corrections:

1. **“It is a difficult time for job finding.”**
   - → awkward phrasing. Better: **“It’s a difficult time to find a job.”**
2. **“Because of AI, the job market is struggling.”**
   - → grammatically fine, but could be smoother as: **“The rise of AI has made the job market more competitive.”**
3. **“firing employees, hiring fewer staff”**
   - → grammatically correct, but “hiring fewer staff” is smoother as **“reducing hiring.”**
4. **“are competing with me in the market”**
   - → not wrong, but better as: **“are now competing with me for jobs.”**

I want to change my life. ~~Recently~~, I need to get some certifications. And then I need to find a job. After that, I need to find some kind of second career.

> Corrections:

1. “Recently” 用错语境，应为“**Right now**”或“**At the moment**”，因为“recently”通常描述过去发生的事。
2. “I need to find some kind of second career.” 表达不够清晰自然，建议改为 “I hope to start a second career” 或 “I want to explore a new path later on”。
3. 多次使用 “I need to…” 显得重复，建议改写提升流畅度和句式多样性。

One of my goals for the future is to change my life. **Right now**, **I’m working on** getting some certifications **so that** I can find a job. After that, I **hope to** start a second career and build something more **meaningful** for my future.

我未来的目标之一是改变我的生活。现在，我正在努力考一些证书，这样我就能找到一份本地的工作。之后，我希望开始第二份职业，为自己的未来创造一些更有意义的东西。

**[Advanced Answer – for Speaking or Writing]**

One of my biggest goals for the future is to completely **transform** my career and lifestyle. At the moment, I’m focusing on earning professional certifications that will allow me to enter a more stable and rewarding field. Once I **secure** a good job, I plan to explore a second career—something more creative or personally meaningful, like starting a small business or working in education. I don’t just want a job; I want a life that feels fulfilling and aligned with my long-term values.

**[Chinese]**

我未来最重要的目标之一是彻底改变我的职业和生活方式。目前，我正专注于考取一些专业证书，希望能进入一个更稳定、更有前景的行业。一旦找到合适的工作，我还计划发展一份第二职业——可能是更有创意、或者更符合自我价值的方向，比如开一家小店，或者从事教育工作。我不只是想要一份工作，而是想过一种真正充实、与我长期价值观相符的生活。

In the sentence **“Once I secure a good job”**, the verb **“secure”** means：**to get or obtain something, especially after effort, and make it stable or certain**.

**“secure a good job”** means：成功获得一份好工作，并确保它是稳定的。
