# Junior's New Business

Eddy comes home from work. His son Junior is excitedly waiting for him.

- **Junior**: Dad, look what I got!

Junior proudly shows his dad a new video game.

- **Eddy**: The new Space Viking game? Where did you get the money for that?
- **Junior**: From my new business. I'm cleaning windows in the neighborhood. My first customer was Bea!
  - I love having my own business. The pay is great!
- **Eddy**: Wow, I'm impressed. I bet you worked really hard!
- **Junior**: Yeah, I'm tired! Can we play my game now?

The next morning, on his way to work, Eddy notices that his neighbor Bea's windows are extremely dirty.

Eddy goes back into the building and knocks on Bea's door.

- **Bea**: Oh, hi, Eddy!
- **Eddy**: Bea, did Junior clean your windows?
- **Junior**: Well… I paid him ten dollars, but he hasn't washed them yet.
- **Eddy**: Oh no. I'm so sorry.
- **Bea**: It's OK. He's just a kid. But the other neighbors are pretty upset.
- **Eddy**: Other neighbors? How many others?

When Junior gets home from school, his father is waiting for him.

- **Junior**: Is something wrong, Dad?
- **Eddy**: Yes. I was late for work today because I spent the morning cleaning windows.
- **Junior**: Are you starting a window cleaning business too?
- **Eddy**: No. I was cleaning the windows you promised to clean. Why did you take money without doing the work?
- **Junior**: I tried to clean the windows, but I'm not tall enough to reach them!
  - But I'm growing, so I should be able to reach them soon.
- **Eddy**: Oh, Junior.

Junior walks back outside.

- **Junior**: Wow, Dad, you really did a great job on all those windows. They're perfect and shiny now!

- **Eddy**: Yes, I know.
- **Junior**: Would you like to be my new business partner?

**Why does Junior say he couldn't clean the window?**

Junior **explains** that he couldn’t clean the windows because he’s not tall enough to reach them — although he adds that he’s still growing, so maybe he’ll be able to soon.

Junior 解释说他没能擦窗户，是因为他的身高还不够，够不到窗户 — 不过他补充说自己还在长个子，或许很快就能擦了。

**Would you like to have a business? Why?**

Yes, I’d love to start my own business in the future. I think running a business gives people the chance to deal with real-world challenges — like solving problems, creating something valuable, and making their own decisions. In comparison, working in a typical office can feel limiting, with **internal politics**, **routine tasks**, and **promotion systems** that don’t always reward true ability. Of course, starting a business **takes courage and clear vision**, but it also brings freedom, a strong sense of purpose, and the chance to make a real difference. That’s the kind of career I want to pursue.

是的，我未来非常想开一家公司。我认为创业能让人面对真实世界的挑战 — 比如解决问题、创造价值，还有做自己的决策。相比之下，在传统办公室工作可能会感觉受限，因为那通常充满内部政治、重复性任务，以及未必真正公平的晋升机制。当然，创业需要勇气和远见，但它也带来自由、强烈的目标感，还有改变世界的机会。这正是我想追求的职业方向。

### Practice History

**Why does Junior say he couldn't clean the window?**

Junior says/ couldn't clean/ tall enough

Junior says he couldn't clean now because he isn't tall enough to reach these windows, but he's growing.

> Corrections:

1. “clean now” → “clean the windows” (clarifies the object of the verb “clean”)
2. “these windows” → **“them”** avoids repetition and improves flow
3. Added em dash “ — ” as per your style preference
4. “he's growing” → “**he's still growing**” makes the contrast more natural and expressive in context

Junior says he couldn't clean the windows because he isn't tall enough to reach **them** — but he's still growing.

Junior 说他没办法擦窗户，是因为他个子还不够高，够不着这些窗户 — 但他还在长个子。

**Would you like to have a business? Why?**

Yes, I would like to have my own business. Only doing business, one can have real connection with the world. Not just play some office tricks for getting promotion and actually do little things.

Yes, I would like to have my own business. Only **by** doing business, one can have **a** real connection with the world. Not just **playing** some office tricks **to** get **a** promotion and actually **doing** little things.

> Corrections:

1. **“Only by doing business, one can…”** → 倒装错误，应为：**“Only by doing… can one…”**
2. **“a real connection”** 正确
3. **“playing some office tricks to get a promotion”** → 更自然表达为 **“playing office politics”**
4. **“doing little things”** → 不够具体，可改为 **“doing very little”** 表达“实际上没做什么事”

Yes, I would like to have my own business. Only by **running a business** **can one** build a real connection with the world — not just playing **office politics** to get a promotion while actually doing very little.

是的，我想拥有自己的事业。只有真正做生意，才能与这个世界建立真实的联系——而不是靠玩办公室政治争取升职，实际上却几乎没做什么实事。

适合写作考试（如 IELTS Writing Task 2 或 B2-C1 写作）的段落版本：

Yes, I would like to have my own business in the future. I believe that running a business allows people to **engage directly with the real world** — through solving problems, creating value, and making independent decisions. In contrast, working in an office often involves **internal politics**, repetitive tasks, and competition for promotions that may not **reflect** one’s actual abilities. Building a business requires **courage**, **vision**, and **responsibility**, but it also offers **freedom**, **a sense of purpose**, and the **opportunity to make a meaningful impact**. That is the kind of work I truly want.

是的，我将来想拥有自己的事业。我认为经营企业能够让人真正接触现实世界——通过解决问题、创造价值、并独立做出决策。相比之下，办公室工作往往涉及内部政治、重复性任务，以及无法真正体现个人能力的升职竞争。创业需要勇气、远见和责任感，但也能带来自由、目标感，以及创造有意义影响的机会。这正是我真正渴望的工作方式。

> Corrections:

1. "through solving" → changed to "by solving" for smoother parallelism with “creating” and “making”
2. Added em dash " — " where appropriate as per your preference

是的，我将来想拥有自己的生意。我认为经营一家公司能让人直接接触现实世界 — 通过解决问题、创造价值和独立决策。而相比之下，在办公室工作通常涉及内部政治、重复性任务，以及对晋升的竞争，这些未必真正反映一个人的能力。创业需要勇气、眼光和责任感 — 但它也带来自由、目标感，以及创造有意义影响的机会。这正是我真正想做的事情。
