# Janet’s Play

**Bea and Lin are watching a play.**

- **Bea**: Lin, wake up!
- **Lin**: Huh? What’s going on?
- **Bea**: You **fell** asleep. Janet will be on the stage soon.
- **Lin**: This play is so boring!
- **Bea**: I know, it’s terrible. But Janet’s our friend. We have to watch her play.
- **Lin**: Ugh, fine.

**Janet walks onto the stage, sits down, and starts crying.**

- **Bea**: Is Janet dressed like a baby?
- **Lin**: This play is so weird. I don’t understand what’s happening.
- **Bea**: She’s a good actress, but this is the worst play I’ve ever seen.
- **Lin**: Let’s go. I can’t watch this anymore.
- **Bea**: OK, but she can’t see us leave.

**They quietly leave the theater.**

**The next day, they’re at the coffee shop. They see Janet waving at them.**

- **Lin**: Oh no, it’s Janet!
- **Bea**: She’s coming to talk to us!
- **Janet**: Hi! Where were you last night? I thought you were coming to my play.
- **Bea**: We were there!
- **Janet**: Really? I didn’t see you.
- **Lin**: We sat in the back of the theater.
- **Janet**: Oh OK. What did you think of the show?
- **Bea**: Um … we loved it!
- **Lin**: Yeah! I loved the part when you cried on stage for twenty minutes.
- **Janet**: Thanks! It was really funny, wasn’t it?
- **Bea**: Definitely!
- **Janet**: Did you like the ending?
- **Bea**: Um … the ending? It was the funniest part!
- **Lin**: Yeah, I laughed so much!
- **Janet**: You both thought the ending was funny?
- **Bea**: Of course!
- **Janet**: But **my character** lost her dog in a flood!
- **Bea**: Oh.
- **Lin**: We couldn’t see the stage very well.
- **Janet**: Then you can come again next week! I’ll make sure you have front row seats!
