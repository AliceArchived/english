# Finished Report - B3

Form: bea@duomail.co

To: emma@duomail.co

**Subject: Your Report is Done!**

Hi Emma,

It's Bea, your favorite colleague and helper! I know you were busy with other tasks, so I decided to write your report for you. You're welcome!

I clearly typed up all the important numbers and details. It felt like a complicated puzzle, but don't worry, I solved it. I also added some positive thoughts to make it sound cheerful. I think it will impress our boss!

I made a special section in your report about budgets. We need to handle money wisely. I thought it was important to show how we can save money for the business. I know you said you were going to include it, but I was faster.

Finally, I arranged everything neatly, and you'd think I was an artist with those pages. Just make sure you review it soon. The boss wants it on her desk by tomorrow morning. Oh, and don't worry about staying late to fix it. I promise it's perfect!

You're welcome!

Love,

Bea

**How do you feel about Bea's help?**

In my opinion, Bea’s help, **although well-intentioned**, may not be **entirely appropriate**. Taking over Emma’s report without asking her first could cause issues later. It might make Emma feel **undermined**, as if Bea doesn’t trust her ability to finish her own work. While teamwork is valuable, boundaries should be respected — otherwise, such help could seem more like **interference** than support. I believe that offering help is best when it's requested, not when it risks damaging trust or workplace relationships.

在我看来，虽然 Bea 的出发点是好意，但她的帮助并不完全合适。在没有事先征求 Emma 意愿的情况下替她完成报告，可能会在之后引发问题。Emma 可能会觉得自己的能力被质疑，仿佛 Bea 不信任她能完成自己的工作。虽然团队合作很重要，但也应尊重界限 —— 否则，这种帮助可能看起来更像是干涉而非支持。我认为，只有在别人请求时提供帮助，才更容易被接受，不会伤害信任或同事关系。

Helpful Phrases: I feel/ In my opinion/ Bea's help

I feel it is a really bad idea for Bea. In my opinion, Bea's help may **cause** future troubles in the future. Normally, we should not do anyone else's job until they ask **us**, otherwise, they may see as a **threat** not a helper.

> Corrections:

1. “cause future troubles in the future” → redundant, "trouble in the future" is clearer.
2. “until they ask us” → "unless they ask us" is more appropriate for expressing conditions.
3. “they may see as a threat” → missing object, should be “see us as a threat.”

I feel it is a really bad idea for Bea. In my opinion, Bea's help may **cause** trouble in the future. Normally, we should not do anyone else's job **unless** they ask **us** — otherwise, they may see **us** as a threat, not a helper.

我认为这是一个对 Bea 来说非常糟糕的主意。在我看来，她的帮助将来可能会带来麻烦。通常我们不应该在别人没有请求的情况下去做他们的工作 —— 否则，他们可能会把我们看作威胁而不是帮手。
