# Formal Attire

Oscar and his friend Eddy are at a charity event at a museum. Eddy looks very uncomfortable.

- **Eddy**: I still don't understand why I have to wear a suit. Some people are wearing jeans!
- **Oscar**: I told you that the event required **formal attire** because you would've worn a tracksuit otherwise.
- **Eddy**: You tricked me!
- **Oscar**: I didn't want you to embarrass me. You're only here as my guest because my best friend, Lucy, had to cancel. So if you wouldn't mind, can we enjoy the event now?
- **Eddy**: Yes, sorry.

Eddy notices that they're standing under a giant **dinosaur** skeleton. He holds his hands up and pretends to look scared.

- **Eddy**: Look! The **dinosaur** is eating me! Take a picture!
- **Oscar**: Eddy! People are staring!
  - Can you please just stand here silently?

Eddy nods. Then he notices a waiter carrying **appetizers**.

- **Eddy**: I'm starving!

Eddy picks up an **oyster** and tries to eat it, but the oyster slips out of the shell and falls on the ground

- **Eddy**: It's so **slippery**!

Suddenly, a waiter holding a tray of food slips on the oyster that Eddy dropped. The tray flies through the air towards Oscar.

- **Eddy**: Oscar, look out!

Eddy jumps in front of Oscar and stops the tray of food from hitting him.

- **Oscar**: That's it, Eddy! I'm never going anywhere with you again.

The museum director rushes over.

- **Director**: I'm so sorry about the accident. Luckily your bodyguard was there.
- **Oscar**: Bodyguard?
- **Director**: Yes, the big guy in the suit —your bodyguard — so you must be one of our celebrity guests.
- **Oscar**: Well, I don't know if I'm a celebrity, but I'm certainly the best artist here.
- **Director**: Could I offer you tickets to our next event to apologize?
- **Oscar**: Hmmm ... I **suppose** my bodyguard and I could attend.
- **Eddy**: If we're going to another event together, does that mean we're best friends now?
- **Oscar**: Let's keep this a professional relationship.

## Writing

### Would you hire Eddy as a bodyguard? Why or why not?

No, I wouldn't hire Eddy as a bodyguard. He always acts so dramatic. If I hired a bodyguard, the guy should be **reliable**.

> Corrections:

1.  **“acts so dramatic”**
    - 用法不太地道。应改为：
    - **“he’s too dramatic”** 或
    - **“he acts too dramatically”**。
2.  “dramatic” 是形容词，通常描述事物或情绪；若描述“行为”，要用副词 “dramatically”。
    - 不过口语中更自然的是说：“he's too dramatic.”
3.  **“the guy should be reliable”**
    - 虽然可以理解，但语气略随意，建议更自然地表达为：**“a bodyguard needs to be reliable”** 或 **“I’d want someone reliable”**。

No, I wouldn't hire Eddy as a bodyguard. He's **too dramatic** and **over-the-top**. If I **had** a bodyguard, I’d want someone **calm and reliable**.

不会，我不会雇 Eddy 做保镖。他太戏剧化了，总是反应过度。如果我雇保镖，我希望对方是冷静、可靠的人。

### Polished

No, I wouldn’t hire Eddy as a bodyguard. He caused a lot of trouble at the museum event—he **made a scene** under the dinosaur skeleton, dropped an oyster that made a waiter slip, and almost got Oscar hit by a tray of food. Even though he did protect Oscar at the last second, it was all his fault to begin with. A good bodyguard should prevent problems, not cause them.

不会，我不会雇 Eddy 做保镖。他在博物馆活动上惹了很多麻烦——在恐龙骨架下搞怪、掉了牡蛎害服务员滑倒，还差点让托盘砸到 Oscar。虽然他最后确实挡了一下，但根本就是他自己引起的。一个好的保镖应该是防止问题发生，而不是制造问题的人。

**“Make a scene”** 的意思：To behave in a loud, emotional, or embarrassing way in public, especially when drawing unwanted attention.

- **大吵大闹**
- 当众出丑
- 惹人注意、搞得很尴尬
- 场面失控的那种出洋相

He **made a scene** under the dinosaur skeleton.

他在恐龙骨架下大吵大闹 / 当众搞怪，引来很多目光，场面很尴尬。

## Sentences

- **“the oyster slips out of the shell and falls on the ground”**
  可以更自然地写成：_…but it slips out of the shell and falls to the ground._
