# Flat Tire, Sunglasses, Shoe - B3

Lin, Joined 2009

Items Sold: 515

---

Hey there! Today, I found some cool things in unexpected places. And guess what? You can have them!

This is what I have today:

**Flat Tire - 5 dollars**

Oh no, I've got a flat tire, and I have no idea where it came from. I found it at the gas station, just lying there. If you collect weird things, this is for you.

It doesn't repair itself, sadly.

**Sunglasses - 15 dollars**

I got these sunglasses from Bea.

She's updating her style and now prefers brighter colors. They're perfect for sunny days. You can watch the world in a whole new way — literally!

**Red Shoe - 10 dollars**

Someone left his red shoe outside my apartment. It's a single shoe. But hey, that makes it unique, right? You can use it as a plant pot, or start a new trend. Wear it and see if anyone notices!

That's all I have today!

Call, text, or email me!
