# Fence Post, Boots, Duck - B3

Lin, Joined 2009

Items Sold: 514

Hi folks! Today, I found some stuff while cleaning up. Well, actually, I just **pushed things around** until I found something interesting. Everything here is ready for you to take home. This is what I have today:

**Fence Post - 8 dollars**

So, I have this wooden **fence post**. I found it in the basement. Do you have a garden that needs a little fence? This post is perfect! Or maybe you want to make a sculpture. Who knows? The possibilities are endless, and **there's no telling** who it belonged to.

**Ranch Boots - 15 dollars**

These are Bea's old ranch boots, still in pretty good condition. They are great for any muddy place or pretending you're on a ranch, feeding cattle like a pro. They have a cool cowboy style!

**Rubber Duck - Free**

Lastly, I have a rubber duck. I found it in the bathtub. It's a little worn out, but still floats. Perfect for a fun bath time or to keep your donkey company. It's free!

That's all I have today!

Call, text, or email me!

## Sentences

- 嗨，大家好！今天我在打扫的时候发现了一些东西。嗯，其实吧，我只是随便翻了翻，直到发现了点有趣的玩意儿。

  - Humorous Effect / Absurdity
    - Saying “to keep your donkey company” is meant to be funny or surprising. It plays on the absurd image of a rubber duck being used by a donkey, which:
    - Adds a silly or light-hearted tone.
    - Makes the rubber duck seem versatile in a ridiculous way.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Which item sounds most useful to you?**

I think the most useful item is definitely the ranch boots. Personally, I don’t **have access to** a yard or a swimming pool, so the other items wouldn't be very **practical** for me. However, a good pair of **durable** boots is always **handy** — whether for walking, rainy days, or outdoor activities. They offer both comfort and protection, which makes them more **versatile** than the other options mentioned. So for my lifestyle, the ranch boots would be the most **beneficial** choice.

我认为最有用的物品绝对是牧场靴。就我个人而言，我没有院子或游泳池，所以其他物品对我来说并不实用。然而，一双耐用的靴子总是很有用——无论是散步、下雨天，还是户外活动。它们既舒适又能保护脚，比起其他选项来说更实用。对我目前的生活方式而言，牧场靴是最合适的选择。

### Practice History

**Which item sounds most useful to you?**

Helpful Phrases: I think/ For me/ The most useful is

I think the ranch boots **are** more useful. For me, I don't have a yard or a swimming pool, so the most useful item is the ranch boots.

> Corrections:

1. “are more useful” is grammatically fine, but "are the most useful" aligns better with the superlative form expected when comparing more than two or when choosing one best option.

I think the ranch boots are **the most useful**. For me, I don't have a yard or a swimming pool, so the ranch boots would be the most useful item.

我认为牧场靴最有用。对我来说，我既没有院子也没有游泳池，所以牧场靴是最有用的物品。
