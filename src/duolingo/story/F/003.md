# Finding a Babysitter - B3

Eddy's Advice Column

Hello, friends!

I'm Eddy. Today, the question is, 'How do I find a babysitter for a date night?' You are in the right place. I know about this! I've had some date nights, and I live to tell the stories. Here's what you can do:

**Ask Friends and Family**

If you have friends or family who can babysit, ask them. It's much easier to trust someone you know. Plus, you might save some money. Babysitting prices can get high. One time, I realized I was paying more for the sitter than the date!

**Interview Many Sitters**

Interviewing multiple babysitters is a great idea. Ask them about their experience and how they handle excited kids like Junior. Make sure to ask about their hourly wage. You don't want surprises when you get home!

**Prepare A Safe Space**

Before you leave, make sure your home is safe. Clear away anything dangerous or breakable. Trust me, a babysitter will say, 'Your house was safe, and that made my job easier!' Junior once broke a lamp while dancing. I don't know how the babysitter managed!

With these tips, you'll find a babysitter and enjoy your date night without stress!

Stay strong!

**Which of Eddy's tips is most helpful?**

In my opinion, the most **helpful** tip Eddy gives is asking someone you already know, such as a friend or neighbor, to babysit. This is because you can trust them more easily, and they probably already understand your expectations and routines. Compared to hiring someone unfamiliar, choosing a known person brings more peace of mind and ensures better communication. Therefore, I believe this tip is both **practical** and **reassuring** for parents looking for a babysitter.

在我看来，Eddy 提供的最有用建议是请你认识的人，比如朋友或邻居，来帮忙照看孩子。因为你更容易信任他们，而且他们可能已经了解你的期望和家庭作息。相比雇一个不熟悉的人，选择认识的人会让人更安心，沟通也更顺畅。因此，我认为这个建议对于寻找保姆的家长来说既实用又令人安心。

I think Eddy's advice about **asking** someone you know is the most ~~help~~ tip.

> Corrections:

1. "the most help tip" is grammatically incorrect. It should be "the most helpful tip" because "helpful" is the correct adjective form. Also, "asking" and "someone you know" should not be separated awkwardly with slashes or pauses.

我认为 Eddy 关于“请你认识的人帮忙”的建议是最有用的建议。
