# Falling Elevator

Lin and Bea are in an elevator. Suddenly, the elevator makes a strange sound.

- **Bea**: Did you hear that?
- **Lin**: **That didn’t sound good**.
- **Bea**: That didn’t feel good!
- **Lin**: Oh no! The elevator is falling!
- **Bea**: Oh good! It stopped!
- **Lin**: I don’t want to die …
- **Bea**: AHH! The elevator is falling again!
- **Lin**: I’m too young to die!

The elevator stops again.

- **Bea**: There are still so many things I want to do in my life!
- **Lin**: I want to climb **Mount Everest**!
- **Bea**: I want to win the New York **Marathon**!
- **Lin**: I want to learn how to **fly a plane**!
- **Bea**: I want to teach my cat to drive!
- **Lin**: Wait, what did you just say?
- **Bea**: Oh no! We’re falling again!

There’s a very loud sound. The elevator stops.

- **Lin**: Wait!
- **Bea**: The **doors** are opening!
  - We’re OK!
- **Lin**: That **was** exciting.

Lin and Bea leave the elevator. Everyone is safe.

- **Bea**: So what are you going to do today?
- **Lin**: **Nothing**. I’ll probably watch TV. What about you?
- **Bea**: Me too. Bye.
- **Lin**: See you later.
