# Front Row

Eddy is on a date with Rose. They go to see a comedy show.

- **Rose**: Let's sit in the front row!
- **Eddy**: Sure!
- **Rose**: Marie Baker is the funniest **comedian**. She always makes jokes about the audience!
- **Eddy**: Marie Baker? Uh-oh.
  - Um, can we sit in the back row instead? Those seats look better.
- **Rose**: These are great seats!

Marie comes to the stage and looks at the audience.

- **Marie**: How's everyone tonight?
  - I see a beautiful elderly couple... Thanks for coming out past your bedtime!

The couple laughs.

- **Marie**: And I see a man in running shorts. Did you get lost on your way to the gym?
- **Rose**: She's talking about you!
- **Marie**: Tell me, Miss, does your husband lift weights while he's sleeping?
- **Rose**: Haha, this is only our second date!

Eddy looks uncomfortable.

- **Marie**: He's wearing those old sneakers on your second date? Please don't tell me there's going to be a third date.

Rose laughs. Eddy doesn't.

Later, Eddy and Rose see Marie at the bar.

Eddy tries to hide his face with Rose's scarf.

- **Rose**: What are you doing?
- **Eddy**: My face is cold.
- **Marie**: Oh, look! It's Eddy, the gym teacher.
- **Rose**: Wait, do you know each other?
- **Marie**: We met at a bar a long time ago.
  - Eddy asked for my number, but he never called me.
- **Eddy**: I wrote your number on my hand.
  - But then my hand **got sweaty** ... and I lost the number. ([ /'swɛti/]adj.)
- **Rose**: Why didn't you save the number in your phone?
- **Eddy**: Because ... I wrote it on my hand.
- **Marie**: Oh, that's **hilarious**. I'm going to use that in my next show.

Marie walks away laughing.

- **Rose**: Wow! You inspired Marie Baker's next joke! You're going to be famous! ([ /ɪnˈspaɪərd/])
- **Eddy**: Great.

## Speaking

Marie likes to make jokes about her audience. In your opinion, what's the best kind of joke? Why?

### Polished

I think the best kind of joke is the one that makes people laugh without making anyone feel bad. That's why I liked how Marie joked about Eddy's outfit or sneakers—it was funny, but not mean. Jokes should be clever and light-hearted, not hurtful.

我认为最好的笑话是能让人发笑、又不会让任何人难堪的那种。这也是我喜欢 Marie 拿 Eddy 的穿着或旧运动鞋开玩笑的原因——那段好笑但不刻薄。笑话应该是聪明又轻松的，而不是伤人的。

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0+

I believe the best kind of joke is one that makes people laugh without hurting anyone’s feelings. That’s why I appreciated the way Marie joked about Eddy’s outfit or sneakers—it was funny and playful, but not insulting. In my view, good jokes should be **clever**, **light-hearted**, and **inclusive**, rather than **mean-spirited** or **offensive**.

我认为最好的笑话是那种能让人发笑、但不会伤害他人感情的。就像 Marie 开 Eddy 穿着或球鞋的玩笑一样，那很有趣又轻松，并不冒犯人。在我看来，好的笑话应该是聪明、轻松、让所有人都能参与其中的，而不是刻薄或带攻击性的。

### Practice

> Corrections:

1. “**recently happened news**” 是不自然的表达，应改为 **recent news** 或 **news that just happened**。
2. “**uncommon things**” 虽然语法正确，但搭配有点生硬，更自然的说法是 **unusual things** 或 **weird/funny things people don’t usually talk about**。
3. “Jokes can also show your attitude about things.” 虽然语法正确，但可以更自然地表达为：**Jokes also reflect your attitude toward things.**

I like jokes about **recent news** or **unusual things**. Jokes also **reflect** your attitude toward the **world**.

我喜欢关于最近新闻或一些少见事物的笑话。笑话也能展现你对这个世界的态度。

I like jokes about powerful people, ~~not normal people~~, especially not about some people in weak positions, such as disabled people.

> Corrections:

1. ""**not normal people**” 听起来语气不太妥当，可能会被误解为对普通人的贬低。更清晰、得体的表达应是 **not everyday people** 或 **not people who are just living their lives**。
2. “**especially not about some people in weak positions, such as disabled people**” 语法上基本正确，但表达略显生硬。可以更自然地说成：**especially not those in vulnerable positions, like people with disabilities.**

I like jokes about powerful people, not **everyday individuals**—especially not those in **vulnerable positions**, like people with disabilities.

我喜欢关于有权势人物的笑话，而不是针对普通人的，尤其不能是处于弱势群体的人，比如残障人士。

I prefer jokes that **punch up, not down**. Making fun of powerful people is fine, but targeting vulnerable groups—like people with disabilities—isn’t funny at all.
（我更喜欢“向上开炮”的笑话。拿有权势的人开玩笑没问题，但拿弱势群体，比如残障人士开涮，那就一点都不好笑了。）

I like jokes about ~~the~~ **comedians** themselves. It's not **proper** to tell **jokes** about someone already in **a** tragic situation**;** yes, it may be funny, but not good.

> Corrections:

1. “**the comedians** themselves” 可以更简洁地说成 “**comedians themselves**”。
2. “**It's not proper to tell jokes about someone already in a tragic situation**” 是可理解的，但可以更地道地表达为：**It’s not appropriate to make jokes about people who are already in tragic situations.**
3. “**yes, it may be funny, but not good**” 语气口语化但不够自然，建议改为：**Sure, it might sound funny, but it doesn't mean it's right.**

I like jokes about **comedians themselves**. It’s not **appropriate** to **make jokes** about people who are already in **tragic situations.** **Sure**, it might be funny, but that **doesn’t make it** okay.

我喜欢关于喜剧演员自己本人的笑话。拿已经身处悲惨境遇的人开玩笑是不合适的。的确，有时可能听起来好笑，但并不代表就是对的。

语气更温和一些

I enjoy **when** comedians **joke** about themselves. **Joking** about people in tragic situations might get laughs, but it often **crosses a line** and **feels wrong**.
