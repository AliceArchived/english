# Flat Tire

Vikram and Priti are **on vacation**.

While they’re driving, their car suddenly **makes** a loud noise.

Vikram stops the car on the side of the road.

- **Vikram**: Oh no!
- **Priti**: What’s wrong?
- **Vikram**: Our car has a **flat tire**! And we don’t have a **spare tire**.
- **Priti**: Let’s walk back to the **vacation house**. It’s only a mile from here.
- **Vikram**: But it’s raining!
- **Priti**: Don’t worry! I have an umbrella.

They get out of the car and start walking together.

- **Vikram**: I’m so sorry, Priti. This is the worst vacation ever!
- **Priti**: No, it’s not! This is actually just like our honeymoon!
- **Vikram**: Oh, you’re right!
- **Priti**: We had a car problem, and we walked five miles to the hotel …
- **Vikram**: But I forgot the key to our room, so I climbed through the window!
- **Priti**: Then you opened the door for me. You surprised me with flowers!
- **Vikram**: That was a wonderful day.

They arrive at the vacation house.

- **Priti**: We’re here! Let’s go inside.
- **Vikram**: Wait … I can’t find the key.
