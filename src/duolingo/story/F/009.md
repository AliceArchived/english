# Front Window

Lily and Zari are watching their new neighbour, Stewart, from Lily's window.

- **Lily**: Zari, have you seen Mrs. Harper's dog recently?
- **Zari**: I haven't seen that dog since Monday. Why?
- **Lily**: I haven't seen the dog either.
  - But on Monday night, I heard Stewart telling Mrs. Harper, "I'll make sure that dog is quiet."
  - And last night, I saw him carrying a large garbage bag...
- **Zari**: Maybe he had a party.
- **Lily**: He didn't have a party. Who would he invite? He doesn't have any friends. He just moved here.
- **Zari**: So the dog is missing, and you saw Stewart throw away a bag of garbage?
  - Do you think ... Stewart killed the dog?
- **Lily**: No. Yes. Maybe.
- **Zari**: We need to look in that garbage bag.
- **Lily**: Yes, we do.

The girls walk quietly past Stewart's apartment...

- **Zari**: We have to be quiet! We don't want Stewart to hear us!
- **Lily**: Then stop talking to me.
  - Here's the bag!
- **Zari**: Open it!

Lily starts to open the garbage bag...

- **Stewart**: Don't touch that!

Stewart is standing behind Zari and Lily.

- **Stewart**: If you open that garbage bag ...

- **Lily**: What will we see?!
- **Stewart**: There will be feathers everywhere.
- **Lily**: Feathers?
- **Stewart**: Mrs. Harper's dog destroyed my feather pillows, so I had to throw them away.
- **Zari**: You have Mrs. Harper's dog?
- **Lily**: Yes, of course. She's away, so I'm taking care of him.
- **Lily**: Wow.
- **Stewart**: Now I need to buy new pillows for the dog to sleep on.
  - And maybe a little sweater so he doesn't get cold. Do you think he will look nice in blue?

## Speaking

Stewart took good care of Mrs. Harper's dog. Have you ever cared for an animal? What did you do?

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.5+

Yes, I once had a cat, and we shared a great bond. I bought him toys, and he loved playing with them. He was surprisingly intelligent. The first time we played, he accidentally scratched me with his claws because I didn’t know how to guide him properly. I didn’t react at the time, but later, when we played again, he still used his paws—just without extending his claws. It felt like he understood how to be careful so I wouldn’t get hurt. I was really impressed by how gentle and thoughtful he became.

是的，我曾经养过一只猫，我们关系很好。我给他买了玩具，他特别喜欢玩。那只猫非常聪明。第一次和他玩的时候，他不小心用爪子抓伤了我，因为我不知道该怎么引导他。当时我没有责怪他，但后来再玩时，他仍然用爪子，但没有伸出爪子，好像他知道该怎么控制，不让我受伤。我真的很佩服他后来变得那么温柔和体贴。

### Practice

Yes, I **had** a cat once and we got along quite well. I bought him toys and he really liked them. When he was a kitten, he could play with the toys all night by himself. However, when he grew up, he asked me to play with him.

3.  “I didn’t nothing.” → 双重否定，应为 “I didn’t do anything.”
4.  “he controled his paw” → “controlled” 拼写错误；且应为“his **paws**”（复数）
5.  “his nails will always inside” → 动词时态与语法错误，应为 “his **claws** would always **stay in**”
6.  “so it would not hurt me” → 应改为 “so they wouldn’t hurt me”

Yes, I once had a cat, and we had a great time together. I bought him toys, and he really enjoyed playing with them. He was very smart.

Yes, I have ~~brought~~ a cat. He was very nice. I bought toys for him, and he really enjoyed them. For cats, toys can also help their intelligence development.

### Describe a time you cared for an animal

_You should say:
– what the animal was
– when and where you cared for it
– what you did
and explain how you felt about it._

**Sample Answer:**

A few years ago, I had a cat, and taking care of him was truly a special experience for me. I adopted him when he was just a kitten, and we quickly formed a strong bond. I didn’t just feed him and clean up after him — I also spent time playing with him and learning to understand his behavior.

One thing I remember clearly is how smart and sensitive he was. When we first started playing together, he accidentally scratched me with his claws. I didn’t really know how to train him, so I just let it go. But later, something amazing happened. Even though he continued to play very actively and energetically — jumping, chasing toys, swatting at my hand — he somehow managed to keep his claws retracted the entire time.

I didn’t teach him to do that, but it was like he figured out on his own that his claws could hurt me. I was really impressed by how controlled and precise his movements were. He was fast and playful, but never hurt me again. That made me feel incredibly connected to him, as if he truly cared about me too.

Overall, caring for that cat taught me a lot about responsibility and emotional connection with animals. It wasn’t always easy, but it was one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had.

### Describe a time you cared for an animal.

A few years ago, I had a cat, and looking back, it was one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had with an animal. He was very active, curious, and smart — the kind of pet that made you feel like he understood everything you said.

I took care of him by making sure he had good food, a clean litter box, and plenty of toys. He especially loved playing with feather sticks and soft balls. I remember buying him different kinds of toys just to see which ones he liked the most.

What really surprised me, though, was how well he learned to control his actions. The first time we played, he scratched me accidentally with his claws. I didn’t know how to train him, so I didn’t do anything at the time. But later, when we played again, he still used his paws — fast and playfully — but he kept his claws retracted the whole time.

I was really impressed by how controlled and precise his movements were. He was still energetic and playful, but he made sure not to hurt me. That made me feel a strong connection with him, as if he genuinely cared about me too.

Taking care of him wasn’t just about feeding or cleaning — it was about building trust. And honestly, he taught me just as much as I gave him.

📝 中文参考翻译：

几年前我养过一只猫，现在回想起来，这是我和动物之间最有价值的经历之一。他非常活跃、好奇又聪明，给人的感觉好像能听懂你说的话一样。

我照顾他的方法就是提供优质的食物、保持猫砂盆清洁，还买了很多玩具。他尤其喜欢羽毛棒和软球，我甚至会买很多不同种类的玩具，看他最喜欢哪一个。

但最让我惊讶的是他控制动作的能力。我们第一次玩的时候，他不小心用指甲抓到了我。我当时不知道怎么训练猫，所以也没做什么。但后来再玩的时候，他动作依然很快、很有活力，但始终**收着指甲**，完全没伤到我。

他**动作很快却控制得非常精准**，我真的非常佩服。他好像也很在意不伤到我，这让我觉得我们之间有种特别的信任感。

照顾他不仅仅是喂食和清洁，更重要的是建立了一种情感的连结。说实话，我从他身上学到的，可能不比我给予他的少。

#### **Part 3 扩展问题与答案（关于照顾动物）**

#### 1. **Why do people keep pets?**

**Answer:**
I think people keep pets for both emotional and practical reasons. On one hand, pets offer **companionship** — they help reduce stress, loneliness, and even depression. On the other hand, some people keep animals for specific purposes, like dogs for guarding the house or cats to keep mice away. But nowadays, most people treat pets more like family members than animals with a function.

**中文参考：**
我认为人们养宠物既是出于情感，也有实用原因。一方面，宠物能带来陪伴，减轻压力和孤独感。另一方面，有些人养狗是为了看家，养猫是为了驱赶老鼠。但现在大多数人更把宠物当成家庭成员来看待，而不是单纯的工具。

#### 2. **Do you think it's good for children to grow up with pets?**

**Answer:**
Absolutely. Growing up with pets can teach children responsibility, empathy, and patience. When kids help feed or clean up after a pet, they learn to take care of others. Also, pets provide emotional comfort, especially when children are stressed or upset. Of course, parents should supervise to ensure safety and hygiene.

**中文参考：**
我完全同意。孩子在宠物的陪伴下成长，可以学到责任感、同理心和耐心。比如孩子帮忙喂食、清洁，就能学会照顾他人。而且宠物还能在孩子情绪低落时给予安慰。当然，父母也需要监督，确保安全与卫生。

#### 3. **What are the disadvantages of keeping a pet?**

**Answer:**
There are definitely some downsides. Pets require time, money, and attention. You have to feed them, take them to the vet, and sometimes even change your lifestyle around them. Also, some people may suffer from allergies, and pets can occasionally cause damage to furniture or disturb neighbors. It’s a long-term commitment, not just a fun hobby.

**中文参考：**
确实有一些缺点。养宠物需要花费时间、金钱和精力。你得喂食、带它们看兽医，有时候还要调整自己的生活方式。此外，有些人可能对宠物过敏，宠物有时也会损坏家具或打扰邻居。这是一项长期承诺，而不仅仅是一个兴趣爱好。

#### 4. **Should people be allowed to keep wild animals as pets?**

**Answer:**
I personally think it’s a bad idea. Wild animals have instincts and needs that are hard to meet in a domestic environment. Keeping them as pets is often dangerous for both the animal and the owner. It can also be unethical and harmful to the ecosystem if animals are taken from the wild. I believe only trained professionals, like those in wildlife rescue centers or zoos, should care for them.

**中文参考：**
我个人认为这不是一个好主意。野生动物有它们天生的本能和需求，在家庭环境下很难满足。把它们当宠物既对动物不公平，也可能对人造成危险。如果从野外捕捉动物，还会破坏生态系统。我认为只有受过专业训练的人，比如野生动物救助机构或动物园的人员，才应该照顾它们。
