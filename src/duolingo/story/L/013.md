# Lin's Resume

Lin is meeting a woman at a cafe for a job interview. She sits down and gives the woman her resume.

- **Woman**: Thank you for meeting me, Lin. You have a very interesting resume.
  - It says that your first job was studying whales in **Antarctica**. (南极)
- **Lin**: Yes, I wrote that on my resume.
- **Woman**: What kind of whales did you study?
- **Lin**: There's more than one kind of whale? Uh… I studied… the biggest whales.
- **Woman**: OK… And then your next job was… working in a **morgue** in Paris?
- **Lin**: Doesn't that sound like a cool job? I've wanted to do that since I was a little girl.
- **Woman**: Really?
  - You seem… very young. You need years of training to work in a morgue, don't you?
- **Lin**: I forgot. I've had a lot of interesting jobs.
- **Woman**: Next, you wrote on your resume that you were a firefighter in **San Diego**…
- **Lin**: Yes, I did!
- **Woman**: I have a brother who is a firefighter there. Sam Watkins. Do you know him?
- **Lin**: Of course, I know Sam! He's great!
- **Woman**: Lin, I lied. I don't have a brother.
- **Lin**: Oops.
- **Woman**: So… are any of the jobs on your resume real?
- **Lin**: No. All of my real jobs were pretty boring.
- **Woman**: Well, I'm so sorry. I can't give you this job.
- **Lin**: Yeah, I understand…
- **Woman**: But I do have a suggestion.
  - Have you ever thought about a career in creative writing?

### What would be your ideal job? Why?

I want to be a **psychic**. Recently years, I become more and more **believe** in such kind of superpower. And I think a lot of things happened not as a **coincidence**.

> 1. **“Recently years”** → 应为 **“In recent years”**（正确表达时间段）
> 2. **“such kind of superpower”** → 语序不自然，改为 **“this kind of superpower”**
> 3. 句式略显松散，需调整语法结构和时态一致性

I want to be a psychic. **In recent years**, I **have come to** believe more and more in this kind of superpower. I think many things that happen are not just coincidences.

我想成为一名通灵者。近年来，我越来越相信这种超能力。我觉得很多事情的发生并不只是巧合。
