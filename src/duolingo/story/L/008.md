# Lin the Lawyer - B2

Lucy comes home in the afternoon **to** her granddaughter Lin and her **neighbor** Junior playing video games in her living room. (British: neighbour)

- **Lucy**: Junior, your dad said you came over to interview someone you admire for a school assignment. I'm ready now!
- **Junior**: I'm actually interviewing Lin.
- **Lin**: Me?
- **Lucy**: Lin?!
- **Junior**: Lin plays video games on the couch all day. That's my dream!
- **Lin**: That's not all I do. I'm a writer. And I used to study law.
- **Junior**: Really?!

**Flashback** to a few years ago: Lin is standing in front of Lucy's door with a suitcase and a stack of textbooks. She knocks on the door nervously, and Lucy answers.

- **Lucy**: Lin the lawyer is home from college for the weekend!
- **Lin**: I'm not a lawyer yet, Grandma…

Lucy hugs Lin and brings her to the living room.

- **Lucy**: Sit down! Tell me about college! I bet you're doing as well as you did in high school.

Suddenly, Lin's eyes fill with tears.

- **Lin**: I can't do it anymore! I study all night, but I'm failing my classes.
  - I don't know if I can be a lawyer.
- **Lucy**: What? You learned how to argue before learning the alphabet!
- **Lin**: It's just… too hard. Besides, being a lawyer is what Mom wanted **for** me… not what I wanted.
- **Lucy**: I never knew that…
- **Lin**: I can't go back to school. I don't know what to do **with** my life.
- **Lucy**: What do you want to do?
- **Lin**: I don't know… I think I'd like to write?
- **Lucy**: Well, you can sit on this couch and figure it out. Take all the time you need.

As Lin's **flashback** ends, Junior turns to Lin.

- **Junior**: Wow! So what did you write?
- **Lin**: I'm still figuring it out.

## Sentences

- **“Lucy comes home in the afternoon to her granddaughter Lin and her neighbour Junior playing video games in her living room.”**
  ❌ Slightly awkward phrasing and verb structure.
  ✅ Suggested fix:
  → **“Lucy comes home in the afternoon and finds her granddaughter Lin and their neighbor Junior playing video games in the living room.”**
- Lucy 下午回到家，发现她的孙女 Lin 和邻居 Junior 正在她的客厅里玩电子游戏。
  - Lucy comes home in the afternoon to her granddaughter Lin and her neighbour Junior playing video games in her living room.
  - The phrase **"comes home to her granddaughter…"** is a common and grammatically correct structure in English, and it's **slightly different in meaning and tone** from **"comes home to see her granddaughter…"** Here's the breakdown:
    - **"comes home to her granddaughter…"**
      - This means that **when Lucy arrives home**, her **granddaughter is already there**.
      - It’s a **descriptive** sentence showing what she finds at home.
      - The structure is:
        **[Subject] + comes home to + [a situation/person already present]**
      - **Example:**
        - _I came home to a surprise party._ → The surprise party was already happening when I got home.
        - _He came home to his dog waiting by the door._ → The dog was already there.
    - "comes home to see her granddaughter…"
      - This would mean Lucy’s **intention** in coming home was **to see her granddaughter**.
      - It changes the meaning — it’s now about **her purpose**, not the situation she finds.
      - **Example:**
        - _She came home to see her sick mother._ → Her **goal** was to visit her mother.

## Writing

## Do you think Lin would have been a good lawyer? Why or why not?

I believe that Lin would not become a good lawyer. She is not dedicated and **hardworking**. To be a good lawyer, one **needs** not only **a** good score at school but also dedication of their work.

> 1. **“and hardworking”** → 应为 **“or hardworking”**，因为是并列否定（not A or B）
> 2. **“a good score at school”** → 更自然地说是 **“good grades in school”**（“score” 通常用于单项测试）
> 3. **“dedication of their work”** → 应为 **“dedication to their work”**（固定搭配：dedication to + noun）

I believe that Lin would not become a good lawyer. She is not dedicated **or** hardworking. To be a good lawyer, one **needs** not only **good grades** in school but also **dedication to** their work.

我认为 Lin 不会成为一名好律师。她既不专注也不勤奋。要成为一名好律师，不仅需要在学校里成绩优异，还要对自己的工作有奉献精神。

更自然、语法正确、适合写作的版本如下：

I do not think Lin would have been a good lawyer. **Although** she was **smart** and **studied hard**, she was not **passionate about** law. She admitted that becoming a lawyer was her mother’s dream, not hers. In the end, she gave up because she realized it was not the right path for her. To be a good lawyer, you need not only good grades and hard work, but also true **dedication** and **personal interest** — which Lin did not have.

[Chinese] –
我认为 Lin 不会成为一名好律师。尽管她聪明而且努力学习，但她对法律并没有热情。她承认成为律师是她母亲的梦想，而不是她自己的。最终她放弃了，因为她意识到那不是适合自己的道路。要成为一名好律师，不仅需要好成绩和勤奋努力，更需要真正的投入和兴趣，而这些 Lin 并不具备。

I believe that she ~~maybe could have been~~ a good lawyer, but clearly something happened in the past. ~~As~~ what I saw, a lot of people have potential, but most of them somehow get lost. Life isn't easy after all, and a lot of people get lost ~~in the middleway~~.

I believe that she ~~maybe could have been~~ a good lawyer, but clearly something happened in the past. **From** what I saw, a lot of people have **potential**, but most of **them** somehow get lost. Life isn't easy after all, and a lot of people get lost **along** the **way**.

> 1. "in the middleway" is unnatural — should be "along the way" or "somewhere in the middle."
> 2. "maybe could have been" is redundant; use either "maybe" or "could have been," not both.
> 3. Repetition of "get lost" could be more concise or stylistically improved.

I believe that she **could have been** a good lawyer, but clearly something happened in the past. **From** what I saw, a lot of people have **potential**, but most of **them** somehow lose their way. Life isn't easy, after all, and **many** people **get lost along the way**.
