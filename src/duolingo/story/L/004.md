# Lily the Interpreter - B2

Lily arrives at school and sees her friend Zari waiting for her.

- **Lily**: Before you ask, I'm not going to the dance on Saturday. I have plans. I'm **watching** a zombie movie **marathon**.

Zari looks upset.

- **Lily**: Are you feeling alright?

Zari sends Lily a text. Lily reads it.

- **Lily**: You can't talk because you have **laryngitis** after screaming at a K-pop concert?

Zari nods her head **solemnly**.

- **Lily**: OK. If anyone talks to you, I'll respond for you instead.

Zari **vigorously** shakes her head 'no.'

Just then, Zari's crush, Troy, walks up to Lily and Zari.

- **Troy**: Hi, Lily.
  - Hi, Zari.

Zari blushes as she smiles at Troy.

- **Lily**: Zari has **laryngitis**, so I'm speaking for her. She wants you to know that she doesn't have time to talk right now.

Zari stares at Lily in disbelief.

- **Troy**: Oh, OK. Well, I wanted to ask if Zari could have lunch with me and my friends today.

Zari enthusiastically nods her head "yes!"

- **Lily**: She's busy.

Zari urgently sends Lily a text. Lily ignores it.

- **Troy**: OK… how about tomorrow, Zari? We could study for the history exam after school?

Zari jumps with excitement.

- **Lily**: Zari's sorry, but she already has plans tomorrow.
- **Troy**: Oh. I guess you're too busy to hang out with me, Zari.

Zari's face turns red, and her eyes fill up with tears.

- **Lily**: She says the only day she's free is Saturday.
- **Troy**: Oh… the school dance is on Saturday. Zari, un, how would you feel about being my date?
- **Lily**: Sure… but she'll only be your date if you wear a blue tie to match her dress. And don't be late.
- **Troy**: Awesome! See you Saturday, Zari!

Zari jumps up and down with excitement as Troy walks away. She turns to Lily and hugs her.

- **Lily**: Now you can go to the dance with Troy, and I can watch my zombie movie marathon.

## Sentence

- 我正在看一场僵尸电影马拉松（连续播放）。

  - I'm watching a zombie movie marathon.
  - 我正在连着看几部僵尸电影。
  - 我正在刷一波僵尸片。
  - 我在看僵尸题材的电影连播。
  - 我在 binge 看僵尸电影。（适合带点口语或年轻风格）
  - A "marathon" in the traditional sense, like a running marathon, is a long-distance event that requires endurance. So why do we use the same word for watching movies? <br/> It's because a "movie marathon" implies watching multiple movies, usually with a common theme or featuring the same actors/directors, in a single sitting or over a short period. This can indeed take a considerable amount of time and require some "endurance" from the viewer! <br/>Here's why the term "marathon" is used for movies:
    - Extended duration:<br/> Just like a running marathon, a movie marathon involves a prolonged activity. <br/>Watching several movies back-to-back takes up a significant chunk of time, often several hours.
    - Emphasis on quantity:<br/>It's not just about watching one movie; it's about watching many in succession. This highlights the quantity and duration of the viewing experience.
    - **Sense of accomplishment:** Completing a movie marathon can feel like an achievement, similar to finishing a running marathon. There's a sense of dedication and commitment involved.
  - 你因为在 K-pop 演唱会上尖叫，现在得了喉炎，说不了话了？
  - You can't talk because you have **laryngitis** after screaming at a K-pop concert?

  - **“Zari jumps up and down with excitement”** – perfectly fine, but could be written more vividly like:
    ✅ _Zari practically bounces with excitement._
  - 属于风格调整

## Writing

### What happened in the story?

In the story, Zari sang songs to hard so she couldn't talk. So Lily talked for Zari. But Lily didn't talk what Zari wanted, only talked what's Lily herself wanted.

In the story, Zari sang songs **too loudly** so she couldn't talk. So Lily talked for Zari. But Lily didn't talk **about** what Zari wanted, **she** only talked **about** what Lily herself wanted.

---

In the story, Zari couldn't talk because she sang K-pop too **loudly**. Lily spoke everything for Zari. **However** Lily did not speak everything **as** Zari's wanted. Lily put her own **ideas** together with Zari's **wishes**.

> - **“sang K-pop too loudly”**
>   ✔️ 语法没错，但更贴近故事表达应是：**“lost her voice after screaming at a K-pop concert”** 或 **“got laryngitis after a K-pop concert”**。
> - **“Lily spoke everything for Zari”**
>   → 结构略生硬，可改为更自然的表达：**“Lily spoke on Zari’s behalf”** 或 **“Lily spoke for her”**
> - **“as Zari’s wanted”**
>   ❌ 语法错误。应为：**“as Zari wanted”**（没有所有格）
> - **“put her own ideas together with Zari’s wishes”**
>   ✔️ 基本能理解，但搭配不够自然。建议改为：**“mixed her own ideas with Zari’s wishes”** 或 **“added her own opinions instead of saying exactly what Zari meant”**

In the story, Zari **lost her voice** after screaming too much at a K-pop concert, so Lily had to **speak for** her. **However**, Lily didn’t always say exactly what Zari wanted. She **added** her own opinions and **changed** what Zari **meant**.

在故事中，Zari 因为在 K-pop 演唱会上喊得太用力，结果嗓子哑了说不了话，于是 Lily 代替她发言。但 Lily 并不总是准确表达 Zari 的意思，而是加上了自己的想法，改变了原意。

一个语法正确、内容完整、表达自然的回答：

In the story, Zari **loses her voice** after screaming **at** a K-pop concert, so she **gets** laryngitis and can't talk. At school, Lily **offers** to speak for her, but **instead of saying** what Zari actually wants to say, Lily **adds** her own **ideas**. When Zari's **crush**, Troy, asks her out, Lily keeps **rejecting** him **on Zari’s behalf**—even though Zari wants to say yes. In the end, Lily agrees to let Zari go to the dance with Troy, but only **under conditions** Lily **makes up** herself.

在故事中，Zari 因为在 K-pop 演唱会上喊太多而失声，得了喉炎，无法说话。她在学校时，Lily 主动提出替她发言，但却没有按照 Zari 的意思去说，而是加入了自己的想法。当 Zari 暗恋的男生 Troy 来邀约她时，Lily 一再代她拒绝——尽管 Zari 非常想答应。最后，Lily 终于“同意”让她和 Troy 去舞会，但附加了一些完全由她自己编的条件。
