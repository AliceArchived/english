# Lily Helps with the Trash

**Lucy is outside of her apartment building.**

**She notices that Lily is moving a carpet, a lamp, and a big, expensive TV outside.**

- **Lucy**: Are you moving?
- **Lily**: No.
- **Lucy**: Are you selling these things?
- **Lily**: No.
- **Lucy**: Then why are you putting all of these things here?
- **Lily**: Because my mom asked me to take the trash outside.
- **Lucy**: I don't think this is what she means.
  - The carpet is new.
- **Lily**: That carpet smells like a dog. And we don't have a dog.
- **Lucy**: Well, yes, it does smell awful. And that lamp?
- **Lily**: I'd prefer to sit in the dark.
- **Lucy**: But that TV is definitely not trash. It looks expensive.
- **Lily**: Do you watch TV? Every show is about money, murder, or dessert.
- **Lucy**: Hmm. I agree, but your mom is going to be mad when she sees this.
- **Lily**: Yes, but she will never ask me to help **with** the trash again.
