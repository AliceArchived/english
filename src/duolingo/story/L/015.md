# Local Park Renovations - B2

Local Park **Renovations** Upset Local Man

Officials have announced that starting next week, renovations will begin on the local park. Many residents are excited about the news, considering the age and poor condition of the park's features.

Who wouldn't love to see our park improved? Well, we recently interviewed a local man named Eddy. He told reporters that he spends 90% of his free time at the park, and he was not happy about the changes.

City **inspectors** have called for immediate improvements to the park due to safety hazards like holes in the sidewalk.

Eddy described these renovations as unnecessary.

- **Eddy**: Jumping over the holes is a better workout than going to the gym.

Eddy was also upset to learn that the pond will probably be closing for repairs, saying:

- **Eddy**: Why would they do that?! Who will feed the ducks now? They'll be so lonely! At least I can still take my son to the playground.

Which is true, until next month, when that will be closing as well. When asked to comment, Eddy responded:

- **Eddy:** They're closing the playground too!? But I… I mean, my son loves going down the slides!

When Eddy was informed that the mayor is considering a complete closure of the park for renovations, he cut off contact with the press, telling reporters:

- **Eddy:** I'm not sure if I should tell you about anything else I like because then that might be shut down too!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**If your favorite place in your city closed, would you feel like Eddy? Why?**

Personally, I really enjoy spending time in parks in my city. **I often go** there to take a walk and enjoy the fresh air. If one of my favorite parks were **to close**, I wouldn’t feel too upset. **I’d** simply go to another one, since there are so many nice parks around.

就我个人来说，我很喜欢在我们城市的公园里待着。我经常去那儿散步、呼吸新鲜空气。如果我最喜欢的一个公园关闭了，我也不会太难过。我会直接去别的公园，因为这里有很多不错的选择。

### Practice Historya

**If your favorite place in your city closed, would you feel like Eddy? Why?**

Personally, I like parks in my city. **I go** to the park, walk around and have some fresh air. I don't mind if it's closed. If it happens, I just to to another park. There are lots of parks here.

> Corrections:

1. “I go” → 改为 “I often go to the park” 增加频率表达
2. “have some fresh air” → 更自然表达为 “get some fresh air”
3. “I just to to another park” → 应为 “I’d just go to another one”（拼写错误 + 用虚拟语气更合适）
4. “lots of” 可换成更正式的 “plenty of”

Personally, I like the parks in my city. I often go to the park to walk around and **get** some fresh air. I wouldn’t mind if one of them closed — if that happened, **I’d** just go to another one. There are plenty of parks here.

就我个人而言，我喜欢我所在城市的公园。我经常去公园散步，呼吸新鲜空气。如果有公园关闭了，我也不介意 — 我就换去其他的公园，这里公园很多。
