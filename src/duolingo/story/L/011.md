# Lin's Guide to Free Food - B2

Lin's Blog, may 31st

Hey everyone, Lin here, with some tips on how to eat like a king or queen without spending a single dollar.

**Weddings**

There's always free food at weddings with buffets — even if you're not invited! Put on your fanciest outfit, sneak in, and start filling your plate.

If anyone gets suspicious, just run to the dance floor and dance next to the bride.

Then everyone will assume you're a guest!

**Grand Openings**

New businesses always want to attract more customers. Use this to your advantage by promising to leave a five-star review in exchange for free sandwiches. It works every time.

**Act Famous**

Do you have a blog or a social media account? Casually mention to a manager that you're "famous," and show them that your last post was liked by more than ten people. They might be impressed enough to give you your entire meal for free.

**Say It's Your Birthday**

Restaurants love giving people free food on their birthdays, so always tell the waiter it's your birthday! Remember not to do this at the same restaurant too often. Otherwise, you'll have to pretend like you have an evil twin.

Now you're ready for a delicious adventure that doesn't cost anything. Enjoy!

## Writing

### Which parts of Lin's advice would you follow? Why?

I think saying the day is my birthday I may follow. But nowadays, some restaurants usually need to check people's ID to make sure the information is real. so just follow their policy, it's not a lie.

> - “saying the day is my birthday I may follow” → awkward structure; better to say “I might follow the part about saying it’s my birthday.”
> - “some restaurants usually need to check” → “usually” and “need to” are redundant; better: “some restaurants check…”
> - “to make sure the information is real” → more natural as “to verify the information.”
> - “so just follow their policy, it’s not a lie” → could be clearer and better punctuated.

I think **I might follow the part** about saying it’s my birthday. But nowadays, some restaurants **check people's ID** to **verify** the information. So if I just follow their policy, it’s not really lying.
