# Lin's Towing Service - B2

Hey, I'm Lin, the owner of Lin's Towing Service, and welcome to my website.

I've needed my car towed literally hundreds of times, usually because I forgot to get gas. I decided to start this business after paying for a tow truck one too many times.

If your car needs to be towed, you don't need to worry. Call Lin's Towing Service, day or night (but not mornings because I like to **sleep in**, and not in the afternoons because that's when I take naps).

Just give me a call and I'll bring a tow truck to pick up your car at my earliest convenience. Whenever that may be.

Maybe you're running late for your own wedding when you get a flat tire, or let's say you're about to **go into labor** when your brakes cut out. You don't have to panic.

Just give me a call, and I'll be there in five minutes… or five hours, if there's a true crime **marathon** on TV.

When I wake up every morning, I know two things: I'm good at towing cars, and things always **work out** - for me, at least.

So all you need to do is give me a ring! I'll always pick up the phone, as long as my phone is charged and I happen to be right next to it.

## Vocabulary

- Brakes cut out: 刹车系统失灵
- Work out: are solved
