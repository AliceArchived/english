# Lin Moves Out - B2

Lucy wakes up **to** noise in her apartment. Annoyed, she walks out of her room to find her granddaughter, Lin, in a business suit, packing boxes.

- **Lucy**: Lin? You're usually in your pajamas all day. How was your interview?
- **Lin**: Hey, Grandma! It went great!
- **Lucy**: What's happening?
- **Lin**: I finished packing. The moving company will be here soon.
- **Lucy**: Wait… You're moving out?! All I asked was for you to get a job.
- **Lin**: And I got one - in Paris!

Lucy gasps.

- **Lucy**: You've been sleeping on my couch for five years… and now you're moving to Paris?
- **Lin**: Exactly!
- **Lucy**: OK, well, I'll make your favorite pasta for dinner tonight.
- **Lin**: Sorry, I have to go.
- **Lucy**: Are you really refusing free food?! That's strange.
- **Lin**: We can have dinner another time! I'll check my calendar.
- **Lucy**: Did you just say you have a calendar? You usually just write everything on your hand!

Someone knocks on the door, and Lin goes to answer it.

- **Lin**: My wife's here with our baby. Hi, babe.

Lin kisses a woman holding a baby. Lucy rubs her eyes, confused.

- **Lin**: Bye, Grandma.
- **Lucy**: You're leaving?! But I want to spend time with you!
- **Lin**: You've done so much for me.

Lin hugs Lucy and turns to leave.

- **Lucy**: Don't go! I'm sorry I asked you to get a job!

Lin walks out the door and disappears.

Lucy starts crying. Suddenly, she wakes up on the couch as Lin shakes her.

- **Lin**: Grandma! I'm here! Are you OK?

Lucy sits up. She looks at Lin, who's dressed in sweatpants and a T-shirt with a hole in it.

- **Lucy**: No suit… That's wonderful!

She hugs Lin.

- **Lucy**: You can stay as long as you want.
- **Lin**: Uhh… Thanks? Hey, did you say something about making pasta? I'm starving.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**How do you think Lucy feels at the end of the sotry? Explain your answer.**

I think Lucy feels **a mix of** relief and **mild frustration** at the end of the story. On the surface, she complains about Lin a lot, but **deep down**, she clearly wants Lin to stay with her. **Still**, when Lin **immediately** asks her to make the pasta, it probably **irritates** her a bit — she just wanted a break for once.

我觉得故事结尾时 Lucy 的心情是又松了一口气又有点不爽。表面上她总是在抱怨 Lin，但其实她心里还是希望 Lin 留下来。然而，Lin 一回来就让她去做意面，可能还是让她有点烦 — 她只是想稍微轻松一下。

### Practice History

**How do you think Lucy feels at the end of the sotry? Explain your answer.**

I think **she** probably feels relieved but also a little annoyed. She always complains about Lin, but **deep down**, she wants Lin to live with her. **However**, Lin asks **her** to do **the** pasta , **which** is a little **annoying**.

> Corrections:

1. “do the pasta” → 更自然的表达是 “make the pasta”
2. “which is a little annoying” 前加 em dash “ — ” 增强语气和结构清晰度

I think she probably feels relieved but also a little annoyed. She always complains about Lin, but **deep down**, she wants Lin to live with her. **However**, Lin asks her to **make** **the** pasta — which is a little annoying.

我觉得她大概感到有点松了一口气，但也有点烦。她总是抱怨 Lin，但其实她内心希望 Lin 和她一起住。然而，Lin 却让她去做意面 — 这还是有点烦人。
