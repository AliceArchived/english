# Lin's Audition

Lin, Eddy, and Bea are in Lin's bedroom, staring at an opened box on the floor.

- **Bea**: So… Why did you **invite** us **over**?
- **Lin**: I'm trying out for a new reality dating show. The producers sent me this disassembled dresser for my audition.
- **Eddy**: Why?
- **Lin**: On the show, two strangers have to assemble furniture together, and if they still like each other at the end, they get married.
- **Bea**: Dating shows keep getting **weirder** and weirder.
- **Eddy**: I can't wait to watch that!
- **Lin**: I need to film myself putting together this dresser for my audition. Could you both help me?
- **Eddy**: Absolutely!
- **Bea**: I don't know… Whenever I help you, I end up doing all the work.
- **Eddy**: Come on, Bea! Don't you want to help Lin find love?
- **Bea**: Not really, but I guess she needs a dresser. Her clothes are everywhere.

Lin hands Bea a tool box.

- **Lin**: Great, you can start without me. I'll be right back.

Lin leaves the room while Bea and Eddy begin assembling the dresser.

- **Bea**: There's no way she'd really marry someone from a reality show.
- **Eddy**: Why not? I would!
- **Bea**: Ugh, this dresser is impossible to build! Wait… Where did Lin go?

Bea sends Lin a text message, but she doesn't answer. Bea and Eddy continue building the dresser.

Finally, Lin returns.

- **Bea**: Lin, where were you?!
- **Lin**: I did some research on the show by watching a few **episodes**.
- **Bea**: Seriously?
- **Lin**: Yeah, and I've decided that I don't want to be a **contestant**.
- **Eddy**: Why not?
- **Lin**: It's too much work. Just watching people put together furniture has made me really tired.

Bea and Eddy both **groan**.

- **Lin**: But thanks for this great new dresser!

Lin opens a drawer, admiring Eddy and Bea's work.

- **Lin**: You really did a great job. And it seems like you still like each other…
  - Have you two ever considered getting married?

## Vocabulary

- Contestant: 参赛者
- Groan: 发出抱怨声

## Writing

### Would you audition for a show? Why?

No, I would never take **an** audition for any reality show. Nowadays, if someone **gets** famous, all their privacy will **be** published, and it's hard to always be famous. Just **trading** all privacy for a short period **of** time to **be famous** doesn't worth it.

> - “take **an** audition” → should be **“audition”** (verb), not “take an audition”.
> - “will **be** published” → “will be exposed” or “revealed” is more natural when talking about privacy.
> - “Just **trading** all privacy…” → should be **“Just trading all your privacy…”**
> - “doesn't worth it” → incorrect phrasing; should be **“isn’t worth it.”**

No, I would never **audition for** any reality show. Nowadays, if someone **gets** famous, all their privacy **is exposed**, and it’s hard to **stay** famous. Trading all **your** privacy for **a short moment of fame** isn’t worth it.
