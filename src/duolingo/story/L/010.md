# Lin's Chores - B2

Junior,

Thanks for agreeing to do the chores my grandma Lucy makes me do in our apartment. Remember, I want you to do a bad job so that she won't suspect that I've paid you $30 to do them.

1. Can you please sweep the living room floor? There's a lot of cat hair even though we don't own a cat. Make sure you miss a few spots so it looks like I did it.
2. You'll need to put the dishes in the dishwasher, but don't turn it on. I never remember to turn it on.
3. The plants need to be watered, but actually, I always forget, so you can skip this chore.
4. My grandma says the pile of clothes on my chair is starting to look like a mountain. Can you hang them in the closet? Make sure to leave at least two items on the floor.
5. Feed my pet mouse, Frank. He's technically just a mouse that lives in our kitchen, but you should leave some cheese out for him.

This isn't a chore that my grandma Lucy makes me do. It's more of a promise I've made to Frank.

This is the most important thing on the list: never tell anyone you did these tasks for me, especially not your dad, Eddy, who can't keep a secret. I don't want my grandma to find out.

Thanks!

Lin

## Sentencts

- 谢谢你同意帮我做奶奶露西让我在公寓里干的家务。记住，我希望你故意做得差一点，这样她才不会怀疑我花了 30 美元请你来做这些事。

## Writing

### Do you think Junior will follow Lin's instructions? Why or why not?

Junior will probably follow Lin's instructions. After all, Lin pays for all these tasks. But I'm ~~doubt~~ for not telling Eddy all their plan. Junior is a kid, he may ~~accidently~~ tell Eddy later.

Junior will probably follow Lin's instructions. After all, Lin pays for all these tasks. But I'm **doubtful about** not telling Eddy **about** their plan. Junior is a kid, he may **accidentally tell** Eddy later.

> 1. “~~I'm doubt~~” → 应为 “**I'm doubtful about**” 表示“我对……有疑虑”。
> 2. “not telling Eddy all their plan” → 更自然地说应为 “**not telling Eddy about their plan**”。
> 3. “~~accidently~~” → 正确拼写为 “**accidentally**”。
> 4. 最后一句是复合句，最好加分号或连接词改善句子流畅度：
>    - 原句：“he may accidentally tell Eddy later.”
>    - 修改为：“he may accidentally tell Eddy later.”（并加前一句用分号连接）

Junior will probably follow Lin's instructions. After all, Lin pays for all these tasks. But I'm **doubtful about** not telling Eddy **about** their plan. Junior is a kid; he may **accidentally tell** Eddy later.

Junior 很可能会听从 Lin 的指示。毕竟，这些任务都是 Lin 出钱的。但我对他们没有告诉 Eddy 这件事感到有些怀疑。Junior 还是个孩子，他可能会不小心把事情告诉 Eddy。

> - “will probably don't” should be **“will probably not”** or **“probably won’t”**
> - “Especially the last one” is a sentence fragment. It should be connected to the previous or next sentence.
> - “he doesn't look like he can” is understandable but could be smoother as “he doesn’t seem like someone who can…”

Junior will **probably not** follow Lin's instructions, **especially** the last one. He's a kid, and he doesn't seem like **someone who** can keep secrets well.
