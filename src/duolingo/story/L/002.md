# Late for the Movie

Lucy is buying popcorn at the movie theater. She sees a man and a woman. She waves at them.

- **Lucy**: John? John! Hello!

The man grabs the woman's hand and starts to walk away quickly.

- **Lucy**: John, wait! It's me, Lucy!

Lucy runs over to them.

- **John**: Oh, hi Lucy… It's good to see you but sorry, we need to go sit down.
- **Lucy**: Movies never start on time.
  - Stay for a minute.
- **Woman**: Sure!
- **John**: Uh… sure.
- **Lucy**: It's been a long time! **How have you been**?
- **John**: Uh… fine. And you?
- **Lucy**: I'm good! I just started boxing, and I love it!

Lucy turns to the woman and smiles.

- **Lucy**: And you look great! Did you change your hair color? You look so good with **blonde** hair!
- **Woman**: No, this is the color my hair **has always been**.
- **Lucy**: Really? **Did** you **stop** wearing glasses? It makes you look so much younger.(~~Are you stopped wearing glasses!~~)
- **Woman**: I've never worn glasses…
- **John**: We really need to leave for that movie…
- **Lucy**: Actually, you look a lot younger now! What is your secret?
- **Woman**: I'm sorry, but we've never met before.
- **Lucy**: What? Of course we've met. I was a guest **at** your wedding.
- **Woman**: What wedding? John and I aren't married.
- **Lucy**: That's funny, **Sandra**.
- **Woman**: My name is **Shirley**! Who's Sandra?
- **John**: Oh hey! The movie is starting now! We have to go!
- **Woman**: John? Who is Sandra?

Lucy starts eating her popcorn.

- **Lucy**: Oh, wow. John, my friend, I think you're going to miss that movie.

## Writing

### What do you think John will do next? Why?

I think John will need to explain why he didn't tell his girlfriend he was married. Lucy made the secret revealed.

> Corrections:

1. "made the secret revealed"
   - → grammatically incorrect. Better phrasing is: **"revealed the secret"** or **"exposed the secret."**
2. "will need to explain" is okay, but **"will have to explain"** is a bit more natural here.

I think John will have to explain why he didn’t tell his girlfriend he was married. Lucy **revealed** the secret.

我认为 John 接下来必须解释为什么他没有告诉女朋友自己已婚。是露西揭露了这个秘密。

---

> Corrections:

1. **“explain his history about his personal information”**
   - → 表达不自然，建议改为更具体清晰的 **“explain his personal history”**
2. **“such as his marriage to his girlfriend”**
   - → 容易产生误解，好像是“娶了现在这个女朋友”；应改为 **“including his marriage, to his girlfriend”** 表达“对女朋友交代婚姻状况”

I think John will have to explain his **personal history**, including his marriage, to his girlfriend.

我认为 John 接下来必须向他女朋友解释自己的个人过往，包括他尚未结束的婚姻。

---

I think John will have to explain something, such as **who** Sandra **is**! And it **seemed** he lied about a lot of information.

I think John will have to explain something — **especially** who Sandra is! **It** also seems like he **lied about a lot of things**, so now he has to come clean.

---

优化的**语法正确、自然流畅的版本**如下：

I think John will have to **explain everything to** Shirley, especially about his marriage **to** Sandra. Now that Lucy has accidentally **revealed the truth**, Shirley will definitely start asking questions, and John won’t be able to avoid the situation any longer.

我认为 John 接下来必须向 Shirley 解释清楚，特别是关于他和 Sandra 的婚姻。现在 Lucy 无意中说漏了嘴，Shirley 肯定会开始质问他，而 John 已经无法再逃避这个问题了。
