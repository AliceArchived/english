# Locked In - B2

Eddy is helping Oscar gather art supplies. They're inside a closet at the school where they work.

- **Eddy**: I love helping you, Oscar. It gives us a chance to catch up.
- **Oscar**: I don't have time to catch up at work, Eddy. I have important things to do, like organizing the paint colours by **shade**.

Oscar tries to open the door.

- **Oscar**: Oh no! The door is stuck!

Oscar desperately pushes the door. Eddy tries to turn the knob, but the door won't open. Oscar begins to panic.

- **Oscar**: This is terrible! We're stuck in here!
- **Eddy**: Oh… well, now we can finally share school gossip! I heard Ms. Vega is dating the new music teacher!
- **Oscar**: Gossip? Someone help! Get me out of here!

Oscar pounds his fists on the door.

- **Eddy**: OK, I owe it to you to get that door open. When I started working here, you taught me everything I needed to know.
- **Oscar**: I only told you where the cafeteria was.
- **Eddy**: And now I think of you whenever I eat lunch.

Eddy takes a few steps back and then slams his body against the door. It still doesn't open.

- **Eddy**: Wow, that's a surprisingly strong door!
  - Oh well, I tried. I guess they'll find us tomorrow.
- **Oscar**: I'll have to stay here all night with you?!

Oscar screams. Then he kicks the door off its **hinges**.

- **Oscar**: Freedom!
- **Eddy**: Whoa, good job, Oscar. Have you been working out?

Oscar suddenly falls to the floor, holding his foot.

- **Oscar**: I think I broke my foot!
- **Eddy**: That's awful! I'll take you to the hospital!
  - Then I'll come over to cook dinner for you every day until you're better.
- **Oscar**: Noooooooo!

Eddy picks Oscar up and throws him over his shoulder.

- **Eddy**: Now we have plenty of time to gossip!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**How would you describe Eddy and Oscar's relationship? Be descriptive.**

From my **perspective**, Eddy **sees** Oscar **as** a friend and tries to connect with him by chatting and gossiping. However, Oscar doesn’t share the same feelings. He finds Eddy’s behavior — especially his habit of gossiping — annoying. In fact, Oscar is so uncomfortable that he deliberately injures his foot just to escape the conversation and leave the closet. This shows that their relationship is one-sided and somewhat **strained**.

在我看来，Eddy 把 Oscar 当作朋友，并试图通过聊天和八卦与他建立联系。然而，Oscar 并不这么认为。他觉得 Eddy 的行为，尤其是爱八卦这一点，让人烦躁。实际上，Oscar 感到如此不自在，以至于故意弄伤了自己的脚，只为了摆脱这段对话并离开储藏间。这表明他们的关系是单方面的，甚至有些紧张。

### Practice History

**How would you describe Eddy and Oscar's relationship? Be descriptive.**

I think that Eddy treats Oscar as his friend while Oscar doesn't think the same way. Oscar doesn't like the way Eddy behave, such as **gossiping**, so when Eddy tries to gossip with him, Oscar even tries his best by hurting his foot to leave the closet.

> Corrections:

1. “the way Eddy behave” → should be behaves (subject-verb agreement).
2. “tries his best by hurting his foot” → unclear and unnatural phrasing. Rephrased for clarity and coherence.
3. Minor punctuation and structure improvements.

I think that Eddy treats Oscar as his friend, while Oscar doesn't **feel the same way**. Oscar doesn't like the way Eddy **behaves**, such as **gossiping**, so when Eddy tries to gossip with him, Oscar even **goes as far as** hurting his foot to leave the closet.

我认为 Eddy 把 Oscar 当朋友看待，但 Oscar 并不这么认为。Oscar 不喜欢 Eddy 的行为方式，比如喜欢八卦，所以当 Eddy 试图和他八卦时，Oscar 甚至不惜伤到自己的脚，也要离开储藏间。
