# Looking for a Babysitter

From: danny@duomail.co

To: eddy@duomail.com

**Subject: Babysitters for Eddy and Junior**

Dear Eddy,

Thank you for using Instant Babysitters. We have many qualified professionals to care for your son, Junior.

Here are the profiles of three babysitters who live in your area:

**Option 1: Liz**

I'm Liz. I have ten years of babysitting experience… OK, that's not true. I only have one year of experience, but it felt like ten! That was the year I was forced to babysit my little sister.

People often describe my **behavior** as "immature" and "childlike," but I think that helps me relate to my younger clients. (British: behaviour)

**Option 2: Justin**

What's up? I'm Justin. The best thing about me as a babysitter is that I'm able to teach your kids how to be independent.

It'll be like I'm not even there (because I might not be).

While some parents complain that I'm not actually watching their children, I think my "hands-off" approach will help your kids become **self-reliant**.

One child **complimented** my babysitting style by saying, "It was like I was totally alone." That's why kids call me "invisible babysitter."

**Option 3: Jess**

My name is Jess, and I'm a fantastic cook. Kids love my food! My **culinary** specialties include anything that doesn't involve a stove, an oven, or a knife.

But in the case of kitchen emergencies, I do have the number of the local fire department memorized.

They even know me by name!

Please let me know which babysitter you'd like to hire to care for your son!

Sincerely,

Danny

Customer Service

## Writing

### Eddy has to decide! Which of these babysitters should he hire? Why?

If I were Eddy, I would chose none of these **babysitters**. All **babysitters** have problems. Liz has **fewer** problems among them, she just **doesn't have** enough experience, but at least she still **has** one year **of** experience. **The** other options seem like they only **cause trouble**.

> 1. **“chose”** → 应为 **“choose”**（虚拟语气中应使用原形动词）
> 2. **“All babysitters have problems”** → 更自然为 **“All of them have problems.”**（避免重复 babysitters）
> 3. **“fewer problems”** → 语法正确，但应该用 **“the fewest problems”** 来突出“在其中最少”
> 4. **“doesn't have” / “has”** → 都正确，但你要求书面语，这里保留完整形式（不要缩写）
> 5. **“The other options seem like they only cause trouble”** → 虚拟语气更自然写法为 **“seem like they would only cause trouble.”**

If I were Eddy, I **would choose** none of these **babysitters**. All of **them** have problems. Liz has **the fewest** problems among them **—** she just **does not have** enough experience, but at least she still **has** one year **of** experience. The other options seem like they would only **cause trouble**.

如果我是 Eddy，我不会选择这些保姆中的任何一个。她们都有问题。Lis 的问题最少，她只是经验不够，但至少她还有一年的经验。其他人看起来只会带来麻烦。

**语法正确、表达清晰、适合写作**的回答如下：

If I were Eddy, I would not choose any of these babysitters. All of them have serious issues. However, Liz seems to be the least **problematic** — although she lacks experience, she at least has one year of babysitting. Compared to the others, who either ignore the children or might cause kitchen emergencies, Liz seems like the safest option. Still, I would rather keep looking for someone more reliable.

[Chinese] –
如果我是 Eddy，我不会选择这些保姆中的任何一个。她们都有严重的问题。不过，Liz 看起来问题最少——虽然她经验不足，但至少有一年带孩子的经验。相比之下，其他人要么完全不管孩子，要么可能在厨房惹出麻烦。尽管如此，我还是会倾向于继续寻找一个更可靠的候选人。
