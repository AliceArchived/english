Lily and Zari are listening to music in Zari's bedroom.

- **Lily**: Isn't Marco's party tomorrow?
- **Zari**: Yes. I hope he invites me. He's so cute.
- **Lily**: He's … alright.
- **Zari**: Just alright? Really? I think he's **magical**.
- **Lily**: Zari, stop.
- **Zari**: He is **as beautiful as the night sky**. I want **to look at** him until he dies.
- **Lily**: Please stop.
- **Zari**: His party is going to be the best party of the year.
  - There will be a real **K-pop** group there.
- **Lily**: A good K-pop group?
- **Zari**: All K-pop groups are good, Lily.
  - Will you please come with me to Marco's party?
- **Lily**: I don't know…
- **Zari**: I can't go by myself!
- **Lily**: Maybe.

**Zari's phone starts ringing.**

- **Zari**: It's Marco! He's … calling me?

**The phone is still ringing.**

- **Lily**: Are you going to answer it?
- **Zari**: Ew, no!
- **Lily**: No?
- **Zari**: No one actually calls people on the phone anymore.
  - It's not cool!
- **Lily**: Very true.
- **Zari**: If he wants to talk to me, he should **send a text**.
- **Lily**: Do you still want to go to Marco's party?
- **Zari**: No. I don't even like him anymore.
