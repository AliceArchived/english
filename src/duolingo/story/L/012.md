# Lin's Letter of Recommendation - B2

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing this job recommendation letter for my granddaughter, Lin, who I believe would make an excellent security guard. You'll notice she has a very unique set of skills.

Lin has good observation skills.

She is an expert at sitting in one place for hours at a time - especially while looking at a screen. Monitoring security cameras is similar to watching reality TV, so I'm sure she'll be great at it.

She also has expert senses.

Lin's sense of smell is incredible, so you wouldn't need to get a dog who sniffs for bombs and other threats.

Additionally, she could be promoted to bodyguard due to her willingness to taste anything, even if it could make her sick. She regularly demonstrates this in my kitchen with weeks-old leftovers when she's too lazy to cook.

On top of all this, she's surprisingly athletic. In the past, she's been able to run faster than the local gym teacher, Eddy, to get the last hot dog at a barbecue.

As you can see, there's no job candidate quite like Lin. Feel free to call my cell phone directly to schedule her interview - Lin's phone is never charged.

Thank you for your consideration,

Lucy
