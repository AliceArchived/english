# Oscar's Day Off - B2

Oscar is outside of the school. He looks very **irritated** as he stares into the window of his own classroom. He hears something and turns to see his student Lily walk by.

- **Oscar**: Lily, you're supposed to be in my art class right now. What are you doing outside?
- **Lily**: Uhhh ... Getting inspiration?
- **Oscar**: It looks like you're playing a game on your phone.
- **Lily**: Wait, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be taking the day off today?
- **Oscar**: Yes, I was supposed to see the new Yayoi Kusama art exhibit at the museum ...
- **Lily**: Cool.
- **Oscar**: But then I found out Eddy was assigned to teach my class today, so I had to make sure he didn't ruin everything.

Oscar **peeks** through the classroom window. He sees Eddy standing in front of his class.

- **Oscar**: What's in that box he's opening?
  - It can't be ...
- **Lily**: Pizza?
- **Oscar**: I specifically said snacks and drinks aren't allowed in my classroom!

Eddy passes out some sodas and turns on some music.

- **Oscar**: No! Is he forcing them to listen to pop music?
  - Only classical music is appropriate for creating art!
- **Lily**: I think he's got it under control ... He found the paint.
- **Oscar**: But where are the brushes?
  - Is he ... finger painting?
- **Lily**: Actually, he's using his whole hand.

Oscar watches as Eddy **dips** his hand into purple paint and **messily** draws a star on a blank canvas with his fingers.

- **Oscar**: The poor students! Eddy is destroying their artistic experience!

The students laugh and talk as they paint and dance to the music.

- **Lily**: Yeah, they look miserable.

Oscar **bangs** on the window with his hands, but no one notices because the music is too loud.

- **Oscar**: This is awful! Don't worry, Lily. I promise that I'll never take a day off — ever again!
- **Lily**: Cool. Well, see you later.

Lily starts walking away.

- **Oscar**: Wait, where are you going?
- **Lily**: Back to your class for some pizza. I'm starving.

## Writing

### Do you agree with Oscar or with Eddy? What is the best way to teach art? Why?

I agree with Oscar. For art learning, students should learn some basic rules first; then they can judge what a good art is; after that, they can be creative about art. Using Eddy's style, students only have fun, but they are not learning even basic art rules.

> Corrections:

1. “what a good art is” →
   - “what good art is” （"art" 是不可数名词，不加冠词）
2. “For art learning” → 更自然表达是
   - “When learning art” 或 “To learn art”
3. 分号使用略显重复，可用连接词或重写改善流畅性。

I agree with Oscar. **When learning art**, students should start by understanding the **fundamental rules**. This helps them **develop a sense of** what good art is. Once they have that **foundation**, they can explore their **creativity** more effectively. Eddy's method may be fun, but it doesn't teach students even the most basic artistic principles.

我同意 Oscar 的观点。在学习艺术时，学生应该首先学习一些基本规则；然后他们才能判断什么是好的艺术；在那之后，他们才可以在艺术上发挥创造力。使用埃迪的方法，学生只是玩得开心，但他们连最基本的艺术规则都没学会。

### Polished - Band 8 Version 🌟

I agree with Oscar. **When learning art**, students should **first** understand the **fundamental rules**. This **foundation** enables them to recognize what **constitutes** good art. **Only** after **mastering** the basics **can they** begin to **explore** their creativity. Eddy's **approach** focuses solely on enjoyment, but it fails to teach even **the most essential principles** of art.

我同意 Oscar 的观点。在学习艺术时，学生应首先理解基本规则。有了这个基础，他们才能识别什么是好的艺术。只有掌握了这些基本要素，他们才能开始发挥创造力。Eddy 的方法虽然强调乐趣，但却连最基本的艺术原则都没有教授。

I agree with Eddy. These students are not **professionals**, they are just high school students. It is more important to let them have fun with art**;** after all**,** most of them will not make a living **from** art. For professional students, a more strict style **may be used**.

I agree with Eddy. These students are not **professionals**; they are just high school students. It is more important to let them have fun with art. **After all,** most of them will not make a living **through** art. For professional students, a more strict style **may be appropriate**.

I agree with Eddy. For most students, they will not **make** a living by painting, so the art class only **needs** to be interesting. There is no need to make it too strict. For students who really want to learn strict painting, they can accept a more strict training.

> Corrections:

1. **“they will not make a living by painting”** → grammatically correct, but slightly unnatural. Better:
   - **“they won’t make a living from painting”**
2. **“the art class only needs to be interesting”** → fine, but smoother:
   - **“art classes should simply be enjoyable”**
3. **“learn strict painting”** → awkward phrase. Better:
   - **“receive more serious training in painting”**
4. **“accept a more strict training”** → “training” is uncountable → should be:
   - **“receive stricter training”**

I agree with Eddy. For most students, they will not **make** a living **from** painting, so the art class **should simply be enjoyable**. There is no need to make it too strict. For students who really want to **receive more serious training in painting**, they can **receive** strict training.

### Polished - Band 8 Version 🌟

I agree with Eddy. Most students won’t make a living from painting, so art **classes** should simply be **enjoyable** and **inspiring**. There’s no need to make them **overly strict**. **For those who** are serious about pursuing art professionally, they can choose to **receive** more **intensive** and **structured** training outside regular classes.

我同意 Eddy 的观点。大多数学生将来不会靠画画谋生，因此艺术课只需要有趣和富有启发性就够了，没必要太严格。至于那些真正想专业学画画的学生，他们可以选择接受更系统、更严格的训练。

I agree with Eddy. These students are not **professionals** — they’re just high school students. It’s more important to let them **enjoy art** and **have fun with it**. After all, most of them **won’t** make a living through art. **For those who** want to **pursue** art as a career, a more **serious** or **structured** **approach** might be more appropriate.
我同意 Eddy 的观点。这些学生并不是专业人士，他们只是高中生。更重要的是让他们享受艺术、玩得开心。毕竟，他们大多数人将来不会靠艺术谋生。对于那些想把艺术当作职业的人来说，更严谨的教学方式可能会更合适。

I agree with Oscar. Oscar is using a traditional way to teach art, but in my opinion, Eddy as a gym teacher doesn't know art at all. Yes, art **needs** some kind of ~~creativation~~, but it should **be** based on someone already know what art is.

> - “art need” → 主谓不一致，应为 “art needs”
> - “creativation” → 拼写错误，正确为 “creativity”
> - “it should based on” → 缺少被动结构，应为 “it should be based on”
> - “someone already know” → 主谓不一致，应为 “someone who already knows”

I agree with Oscar. **He’s** using a more traditional way to teach art, **and I think** that makes sense. In my opinion, Eddy, as a gym teacher, **doesn’t really understand** art. Yes, **creativity** is important in art, but it should be based on **a solid understanding of** what art actually is. Without that **foundation**, students may not know how to express themselves properly.

我同意 Oscar 的观点。他采用的是一种更传统的艺术教学方式，我认为这是有道理的。在我看来，Eddy 作为体育老师，并不真正了解艺术。确实，艺术需要创造力，但这种创造力应该建立在对艺术本身有清晰理解的基础之上。否则，学生可能根本不知道如何正确地表达自己。

### Polished

> 🌟 IELTS Band 8 Version:

I agree with Oscar because he **adopts** a more traditional and structured **approach** to **teaching** art, which I believe is **entirely** reasonable. **In contrast**, Eddy, as a gym teacher, may not have a deep understanding of what art truly involves. While creativity is **undoubtedly** important, it should be **grounded in a solid foundation of artistic principles and techniques**. Without this foundation, students might **struggle** to **express** themselves effectively or **develop their artistic potential** in a meaningful way.

我同意 Oscar 的观点，因为他采用的是一种更传统、更有体系的艺术教学方法，我认为这是合理的。相比之下，作为体育老师的 Eddy 可能并不真正了解艺术的内涵。虽然创造力无疑很重要，但它应当建立在扎实的艺术基础之上。没有这个基础，学生可能难以有效地表达自己，也无法有意义地发展他们的艺术潜力。

1. Why is **“teaching”** correct?

   - In this case, **“to”** is not part of the infinitive **(to + verb)** — it's actually a **preposition**.
   - When “to” is used as a **preposition**, it must be followed by a **noun or gerund (-ing form)**.
   - **“approach to”** = prepositional phrase
   - approach to teaching art

2. undoubtedly: 英 /ʌnˈdaʊtɪdli/ 美 /ʌnˈdaʊtɪdli/
   - adv. 毋庸置疑地,的确地

### 1. Make a living _from_ art

- **Most natural and common** in this context.
- Emphasizes that art is the **source** of income.
- **Example:** She makes a living from art **by** selling her paintings.

### 2. Make a living _by_ art

- Less common and a bit **old-fashioned** or literary.
- Grammatically correct, but not used much in modern spoken English.
- Usually used when followed by a **specific action**:
  → _"make a living by painting / by teaching art."_
- Not wrong, but sounds a little off without a specific verb after "by."

### 3. Make a living _through_ art

- Also correct, but slightly more **abstract or poetic**.
- Suggests art is the **means or medium** through which someone earns a living.
- **Example:** He made a living through art, inspiring people and selling his work.
