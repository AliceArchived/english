# On the News

Zari and Lily are watching the news on TV.

A reporter is interviewing a woman who rescued a boy from a lake.

- **Zari**: I wish I could be on the news.
- **Lily**: Really? I would hate all that attention.
- **Zari**: I wouldn't! I would be a great hero.
- **Lily**: That sounds like a nightmare to me.
- **Zari**: I have an idea! We should rescue someone.
- **Lily**: You rescue. I'll watch.

Zari and Lily walk around the neighborhood.

- **Zari**: I'm going to help that man cross the street.
- **Lily**: Why? There are no cars coming.

Zari runs to help the man.

- **Zari**: Excuse me, sir. Can I help you cross this busy street?
- **Man**: What? I don't need help!
- **Zari**: But I thought older people need help crossing the street‚Ä¶
- **Man**: I'm only forty-five!

Zari runs back to Lily.

- **Lily**: Well, that was a bad idea.
- **Zari**: You're right.
  - Let's find a burning building and I'll rescue someone.
- **Lily**: Maybe we should go home before you get hurt.
- **Zari**: I could rescue a cat from a tree‚Ä¶
- **Lily**: What cat?
- **Zari**: That cat.

Zari points at a cat resting on the sidewalk.

- **Lily**: That cat is not **in** a tree.
- **Zari**: Not yet.

Zari grabs the cat and starts climbing a tree.

- **Lily**: Zari, this is a terrible idea.

Later, Junior is at his home watching the news on TV.

- **Junior**: Dad, look! A reporter is interviewing my babysitter, Zari!
- **Reporter**: I climbed up this tree to talk to this embarrassed young girl.
  - Now, you said you were trying to rescue a cat‚Ä¶ but where's the cat?
- **Zari**: Uh, the cat climbed down. And I got stuck **in** the tree.
- **Junior**: Wow! I guess it's pretty easy to get on the news.

**Would you like to be on the news? Why?**

> Corrections:

1. ‚Äúeveryone notice me‚Äù ‚Üí should be **‚Äúeveryone notices me‚Äù** (subject-verb agreement).
2. ‚Äúafterwards it will cause too much trouble‚Äù ‚Üí smoother phrasing would be **‚Äúbut afterward, it causes too much trouble.‚Äù**

No, I would not like to be on the news. Personally, I don't like drawing too much attention. It feels good when everyone **notices** me, but **afterward,** it causes too much trouble.

> Corrections:

1. I added ‚Äúat first‚Äù to clarify the contrast between initial positive feeling and later trouble (this makes it flow more naturally and clearly).

No, I would not like to be on the news. Personally, I don‚Äôt like drawing too much attention. It feels good when everyone notices me a**t first**, but afterward, it causes too much trouble.
