# Oscar's Diary Entry, May 16th - B2

Dear Diary,

It's been a very emotional day. I was shopping at my favourite store, Fance. OK, I was actually just admiring all of the **stylish** clothing. As an artist **on a budget**, I was too wise to buy such expensive clothes — until Gerald arrived.

**Gerald**, the most **sophisticated** gallery owner in town, walked in wearing pink pants — just like mine! And his moustache was perfect.

At that point, I was seriously regretting that I hadn't spent the usual 60 minutes **grooming** my moustache that morning.

How embarrassing! I knew that I must not let him see my face, so I desperately grabbed a pair of sunglasses and put them on. Imagine my horror when Gerald walked right towards me!

"Lovely sunglasses!" he said. "I have a pair just like those."

I couldn't believe that Gerald Klein thought we had the same taste!

"Oh, I've had these for years," I said, hoping he wouldn't see the price tag attached to them.

Gerald smiled and walked away.

I hadn't wanted to purchase the sunglasses, but now I needed to purchase them. Those sunglasses **represented** everything I'd been trying to achieve — sophistication, distinction, style.

"Those will be $500, please." the clerk said.

Sadly, I had to leave the sunglasses and rush out of the store. Although my taste is excellent, my budget is not.

**What did Oscar write about in his diary?**

In his diary, Oscar described an awkward experience he had at a high-end store. He was admiring the expensive items when he unexpectedly bumped into someone he really looked up to. Trying to appear impressive, he pointed to a pair of sunglasses and claimed that he had owned them for years. After saying that, he felt the need to actually buy them to support his story. Unfortunately, when he checked the price, it was far too expensive, so he left without buying anything.

### Practice History

**What did Oscar write about in his diary?**

In his diary, Oscar recorded his experience in a **luxury** store. He liked the items in that store, but all items were quite expensive. But he met a guy he always looked up to, and he pretended to have a paire of an expensive sunglasses. So he considered to buy them. But they were out of his budget.

> Corrections:

1. “a paire of an expensive sunglasses” → grammatically incorrect; correct form is “an expensive pair of sunglasses.”
2. “considered to buy” → should be “considered buying” (standard gerund usage after "consider").
3. "But they were out of his budget" → phrasing improved to “beyond his budget.”
4. “He pretended to have” → more natural in this context to say “**pretended to already own**.”
5. Slight reordering and wording makes the timeline and logic clearer.

In his diary, he recorded an **embarrassing** experience. He lied about he had a pair of fancy sunglasses, then he tried to buy them to fix the lie, but because the sunglasses **were** too expensive, he **ended up** buying nothing.

> Corrections:

1. “he lied about he had” → should be **“he lied about having”**.
2. “to fix the lie” → fine, but could be smoother as **“to cover up the lie.”**
3. “the sunglasses were too expensive, he ended up buying nothing” → this is a comma splice; it should be separated properly.

> Corrections:

1. "lied about having" → better phrased as "lied about **owning**" to align with natural usage regarding possession.
2. "then tried to buy them" → kept, but adding "later" helps smooth the time sequence.
3. Sentence structure is solid, but slight wording refinement raises fluency.

In his diary, he recorded an embarrassing experience. He lied about owning a pair of fancy sunglasses and later tried to buy them to **cover up** the lie. However, since the sunglasses were too expensive, he ended up buying nothing.
