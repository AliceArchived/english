# Oscar the Babysitter - B2

Eddy **frantically** knocks on his friend Oscar's door. Eddy has his son, Junior with him.

- **Eddy**: Can you please babysit Junior? I have a doctor's appointment, but the babysitter canceled, so now there's no one to watch Junior.
- **Oscar**: I'm not a babysitter, Eddy.
- **Eddy**: Please, Oscar! You're my best friend, and you're great with kids.
- **Oscar**: I'm neither of those things.
- **Eddy**: It's just for a few hours!
- **Oscar**: OK, fine.

Eddy quickly leaves.

- **Oscar**: Alright, Junior, what do you usually do with your babysitter?
- **Junior**: Zari lets me watch movies!
- **Oscar**: What do you like to watch? French new wave? **Film noir**?
- **Junior**: How about "Cars vs. Robots"?

Oscar looks disgusted.

- **Oscar**: Forget ridiculous action movies. I'm going to teach you about artistic films.
- **Junior**: Can we eat first?

Junior takes a container of chicken **nuggets** out of his backpack.

- **Junior**: Do you want one?
- **Oscar**: Absolutely not.
- **Eddy**: Just try one! They're delicious.

Oscar **frowns** as he takes the smallest possible bite of a chicken nugget.

- **Oscar**: Wow ... I always assumed I would hate chicken nuggets, but they aren't as terrible as I expected them to be.

Oscar eats three more chicken nuggets.

- **Junior**: You know, there's a lot I can teach you.
- **Oscar**: Really? What else do you recommend?
- **Junior**: My favorite video game, Museum of **Doom**!
  - In this game, you get trapped in a haunted museum. All the paintings **come to life**, so you have to fight them in order to escape!
- **Oscar**: Hmmm ... I usually can't stand video games, but I'm **intrigued**.

A few hours later, Eddy arrives to pick up Junior. Junior and Oscar are playing video games, surrounded by candy wrappers.

- **Eddy**: Wow, Oscar, you're really good at Museum of Doom! Can I join in?
- **Junior**: No, Dad. It's a two-player game.
- **Oscar**: Go home, Eddy. I'll bring Junior home after we **beat this level**.
  - Despite what I initially thought ...
  - I'm great with kids!

## Writing

### Do you think Oscar is a good babysitter? Why or why not?

I believe that Oscar is not a good babysitter. Junior is so good at dealing with people, and almost all kinds of people eventually do what he **wants** them to do. Oscar **cannot** control **the** kids' behavior, so the kids **are** either not willing to follow Oscar's instructions, or Oscar just follows the kids' instructions.

> - “do what he wants them to do” 是正确的结构，但上下文略显跳跃，可稍微解释“他”是谁
> - “Oscar cannot control the kids' behavior” 是正确的语法，但语气可以更自然
> - “are either not willing to follow… or Oscar just follows…” → 平行结构略生硬，建议更顺畅地表达

I believe that Oscar is not a good babysitter. Junior is very good at dealing with people, and most people eventually do what he **wants** them to do. But Oscar can’t really **manage** the kids — they either **ignore his instructions**, or he ends up doing whatever they say instead.

我认为 Oscar 不是一个称职的保姆。Junior 很擅长与人打交道，大多数人最终都会听他的。但 Oscar 似乎无法真正管住孩子们——他们要么无视他的指令，要么就是他反而听从了孩子们的话。

#### **High-Scoring Version**

I don’t think Oscar is a very good babysitter. **From what I’ve seen**, he struggles to manage the children effectively. Junior, for example, is great at **influencing** others — he knows how to communicate and **get people to do** what he wants. **In contrast**, Oscar doesn’t seem to have much authority or control.

The kids either ignore what he says, or worse, he ends up following their lead instead. A good babysitter should be able to set **boundaries** and earn the children’s **respect**, but Oscar seems to lack both confidence and consistency in that role.

我不认为 Oscar 是一个很好的保姆。从我观察来看，他很难有效地管住孩子们。比如说，Junior 就非常擅长影响别人，他懂得如何沟通，让别人按他的意愿行事。相比之下，Oscar 似乎没有什么威信或控制力。

孩子们要么无视他说的话，更糟的是，有时变成他反过来听从孩子们的安排。一个合格的保姆应该能够设定规则并赢得孩子们的尊重，但 Oscar 似乎在这方面缺乏信心和稳定性。

- 你喜欢看什么？法国新浪潮？**黑色电影**？
  - What do you like to watch? French new wave? **Film noir**?
  - **Film noir** (French for "black film" or "dark film") refers to a style of films popular in the 1940s and 1950s in Hollywood. These films are characterized by their dark visual style (low-key lighting and shadows), themes of crime, betrayal, and moral ambiguity, and complex, twisted storylines. Protagonists are often flawed or antiheroes, and there's frequently a femme fatale who manipulates the story. The term "noir" was coined by French critics to describe these movies because of their metaphorical and literal darkness.
  - **Film noir**（法语意为“黑色电影”或“暗黑电影”）指的是 20 世纪 40 年代和 50 年代在好莱坞流行的一种电影风格。这类电影的特点是视觉风格昏暗（低调灯光和阴影）、涉及犯罪、背叛和道德模糊的主题，以及复杂曲折的情节。主角往往是有缺陷的反英雄角色，故事中经常会有操控情节发展的**蛇蝎美人**。法国影评人最早用“noir”这个词来形容这些电影，因为它们在主题和视觉上都充满了“黑暗感”。
