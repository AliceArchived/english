# Oscar in Los Angeles

**Oscar is visiting his cousin, Orson, in Los Angeles.**

**He walks into the kitchen with his camera and guidebook.**

- **Orson**: Good morning, Oscar! I’m working today, but I can give you direction**s** to any place in the city.

**Oscar points to a page in the guidebook.**

- **Oscar**: Where’s the famous **sidewalk** with all the stars **on** the ground?
- **Orson**: That’s on the west side of the city. You have to **drive on the highway** for an hour and **get off on** Hollywood Boulevard.
- **Oscar**: An hour?! That’s too long.
  - **How far** is the **Hollywood** sign from here?
- **Orson**: That’s in the north part of the town.
  - You’ll have to **drive straight on** Vermont Avenue for an hour.
- **Oscar**: Maybe I’ll go to Malibu.
- **Orson**: Oh no. If you want to go there, then you’ll be **in traffic** for at least two hours.
- **Oscar**: Is there any place that takes less than an hour to **get** to?
- **Orson**: The art museum is only fifty-nine minutes from here!

**Oscar leaves the kitchen.**

- **Orson**: So, where are you going?
- **Oscar**: You just got a new TV, right?
- **Orson**: Yes! It’s in the living room.
- **Oscar**: That’s where I’m going.
