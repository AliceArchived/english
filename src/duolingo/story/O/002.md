# Opera Frog - B2

Eddy and his son, Junior, meet their neighbor Oscar in the lobby of the opera house.

- **Oscar**: Junior, I got this ticket for you because you're still young enough to learn about the beauty of opera. And Eddy, please try to stay awake this time.

As they find their seats, Oscar hears a **noise** coming from Junior's pocket.

- **Oscar**: Junior, why is your suit jacket **croaking**?
- **Junior**: It's just my frog, Sugar.
- **Oscar**: You brought a frog to the opera?!
- **Junior**: Sugar loves music! You should hear her sing in the shower.
- **Oscar**: You can't bring a frog to the opera! Take that thing home immediately!

Suddenly, the orchestra starts playing.

- **Oscar**: The show's starting. Make sure that frog stays quiet.
- **Junior**: Don't worry, Sugar is very well-behaved.

Two minutes after the show begins, Junior **crawls** around on the floor, looking under the seats.

- **Oscar**: What are you doing? Get up from there!
- **Junior**: Sugar's gone! I can't find her! Dad, help me look for Sugar.

Eddy **drops** to the floor and starts searching.

- **Eddy**: Come here, Sugar!

Suddenly, there's a **gasp** on stage, and a frog **hops** out from underneath the lead singer's hat.

- **Junior**: Sugar, there you are! Thank goodness!

Surprised, the singer sings a **note** so high that it **causes wine glasses to break**. The audience claps loudly.

- **Audience1**: Impressive **high note**!
- **Audience2**: Incredible!

Still singing, the **frustrated** opera singer **chases** Sugar, who **hops around** the stage, **overturning** scenery. The audience laughs and cheers wildly.

Junior jumps on stage and chases Sugar, finally **catching** her.

- **Junior**: Phew, Sugar! I'm so relieved!

Eddy turns to Oscar, embarrassed.

- **Eddy**: I'm so sorry, Oscar!
- **Oscar**: Don't be sorry. This was actually the best performance I've ever seen by that singer! She can't usually sing those high **notes**!

## Writing

### What was your favorite part of the story? Why?

My favorite part was **when Sugar** can **make** the singer **sing** even better, that was a surprise.

> Corrections:

1. **“Sugar can make the singer singing even better”**
   - → incorrect verb form. Should be **“make the singer sing”** (not “singing”).
2. **“when Sugar can make...”**
   - → better as **“when Sugar could make...”** to match past tense with the rest of the sentence.

My favorite part was **when Sugar could** make the singer sing even better — that was a surprise.

我最喜欢的部分是糖糖竟然能让歌手唱得更好——这太令人惊喜了。

My favorite part was when the singer was surprised by Sugar, she actually sang better.

### Polished

My favorite part was when Sugar suddenly jumped out from under the opera singer’s hat during the performance. The singer was so surprised that she **sang** a **super high note** — so high that it broke wine glasses! The audience loved it and started clapping loudly. I liked this part because it was **totally unexpected** and turned a serious opera into something hilarious and unforgettable. Even Oscar, who was annoyed at first, admitted it was the singer’s best performance ever!

我最喜欢的部分是 Sugar 突然从歌剧演员的帽子里跳出来的时候。那位歌手太惊讶了，竟然唱出了一个超高音，高到把酒杯都震碎了！观众们立刻鼓起掌来，反应热烈。我喜欢这一段是因为它完全出乎意料，把一场严肃的歌剧变成了又搞笑又难忘的场面。就连一开始很生气的 Oscar 最后也承认，这是那位歌手最精彩的一次演出！

**✨ IELTS Band 8 Sample Answer:**
The moment I enjoyed most in the story was when Sugar, the frog, unexpectedly **leapt** out from beneath the opera singer’s hat during the performance. **Startled**, the singer **let out** an incredibly high note — so powerful that it **shattered** wine glasses. The audience responded with loud **applause** and **laughter**, completely entertained by the chaos. I found this scene especially memorable because it transformed what was supposed to be a serious opera into something surprisingly **comedic** and **delightful**. It was also amusing to see how **even** Oscar, who was initially upset, ended up admitting that it was the best performance he'd ever seen from that singer.

我最喜欢的情节是糖糖这只青蛙在演出中突然从歌剧演员的帽子里跳出来。那位歌手被吓了一跳，唱出了一个震碎酒杯的高音，观众们爆发出热烈的掌声和笑声。这个场景让我印象特别深刻，因为它让原本严肃的歌剧变得又滑稽又有趣。更好笑的是，一开始生气的奥斯卡最后竟然承认，这是他见过这位歌手最精彩的一次演出。
