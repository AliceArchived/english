# Oscar's Winter Gathering Invitation - B2

Congratulations! You've been invited to Oscar's Winter Gathering on December 29th. It's the city's most **exclusive** event to discuss the best and worst in arts and culture this year.

This invitation means that Oscar considers you intelligent enough to share your opinions with him!

Guests must keep in mind the following rules:

### 1. No **Uninformed** Opinions

Guests must confirm that they have read and watched everything on Oscar's annual list of 100 books and films.

Please note, Oscar may ignore this rule for people who can prove that they're as knowledgeable as he is… or have won a **Nobel** Prize.

### 2. No Red Wine

Last year, Oscar kindly forgave Vikram for spilling a drop of red wine on his valuable white rug. This was only after Vikram apologized repeatedly and replaced the ruined rug with a more expensive one. As a result, guests may only enjoy clear liquids.

### 3. No Children

Although Oscar loves teaching children, this gathering is his opportunity to teach adults. And frankly, adults need more instruction about arts and culture than children.

Those who break the rules will not be invited back next year. Oscar looks forward to seeing you!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Would you go to Oscar's Winter Gathering? Why or why not?**

I wouldn’t go to Oscar’s Winter Gathering. **From the invitation**, I **get the impression** that he’s **quite full of himself**. I **mean**, how many people can really win a Nobel Prize? Does he even have that **level** of knowledge? And why should Vikram **be expected to** make up for his mistake by buying a more expensive rug? That just doesn’t seem fair at all.

我不会去 Oscar 的冬季聚会。从邀请来看，我觉得他挺自大的。我是说，有多少人能真正拿到诺贝尔奖呢？他真的有那样的学识吗？而且为什么 Vikram 要被要求用更贵的地毯来弥补他的错误？这听起来一点都不公平。

- “Should Vikram **be expected** to make up for his mistake…”
  - This phrasing talks about what is expected or reasonable in general — it reflects on what’s fair, not what actually happened.
  - It’s more about questioning whether the expectation itself (even if already imposed or acted on) was fair or justified.

### Practice History

**Would you go to Oscar's Winter Gathering? Why or why not?**

I would not go to Oscar's Winter Gathering. From the invitation above, I can see that Oscar is a person full of ego. How many people can actually get a Nobel Prize? Does himself knowledgable enough? And why Vikram should made up his mistake by replace a more expensive rug? It's unreasonable!

> Corrections:

1. “Does himself knowledgable enough?” → incorrect word order and form; should be “Is he knowledgeable enough himself?”
2. “should made up” → wrong tense; should be “should have to make up”
3. “by replace” → needs to be “by replacing”
4. “a person full of ego” → smoother as “full of ego” (or “so full of himself”)
5. Minor style tweaks for naturalness (e.g., “win a Nobel Prize” sounds more idiomatic than “get a Nobel Prize”)

I would not go to Oscar’s Winter Gathering. From the invitation above, I can **tell** that Oscar **is full of ego**. How many people can actually **win** a Nobel Prize? Is **he** knowledgeable enough **himself**? And why should Vikram **have to make up** for his mistake by **replacing** the rug with a more expensive one? That’s unreasonable!

我不会去 Oscar 的冬季聚会。从上面的邀请中，我可以看出 Oscar 非常自大。到底有多少人能真正赢得诺贝尔奖？他自己真的足够有学识吗？而且为什么 Vikram 必须用更贵的地毯来弥补他的错误？这太不合理了！
