# Best of the City - B2

Bea is giving her "Best of the City" tour to a group of tourists as part of her new business. Her friend Lin is there, training to be a tour guide.

With the **exception** of Bea, everyone looks exhausted.

- **Bea**: Wasn't that museum amazing!? We've got three more museums to see!
- **Lin**: But we've already been to two museums, five churches, and four art galleries. And it's only noon.
  - As far as I know, this tour is called "Best of the City," not "Everything in the City."
- **Bea**: But these are the best places in the city!
- **Lin**: But I'm hungry.

Bea's phone buzzes. She checks it and turns to Lin.

- **Bea**: Someone **showed up** to the tour late. I'll go get them.
  - Could you continue the tour? It'll be fine, as long as you follow the schedule!

Bea hands Lin a schedule and leaves. Lin turns to the tourists.

- **Lin**: Now that I'm in charge, who wants sandwiches?

An hour later, Bea and a tourist arrive at the art museum, but the tour group isn't there:

- **Bea**: I'm sorry. They should be here…

After checking every stop on the tour, they find Lin and the tour group eating cookies at Vikram's bakery.

- **Bea**: Did you go to any of the places on my schedule!?
- **Girl**: Nope! We were hungry after all the museums this morning, so Lin took us to the best sandwich shop in the city.
- **Man**: Then we were tired, so Lin took us to the park to **nap**.
- **Bea**: That's all you did?
- **Lin**: I also brought them here for cookies.
- **Bea**: I'm so sorry Lin didn't finish the tour! I'll give you your money back.
- **Girl**: But we don't want our money back!
- **Man**: Can Lin lead the tour again tomorrow?

**Would you prefer to go on a tour with Lin or with Bea? Why?**

I’d prefer to go on a tour with Lin because she really knows how to help people relax. When I’m on holiday, I don’t want anything to be stressful — I just want to enjoy myself and take it easy.

我更愿意和 Lin 一起去旅行，因为她真的很懂得如何让人放松。假期的时候，我不希望有任何压力——我只想好好享受，轻松一下。

When I was **younger**, I think I **would have preferred** to go on a tour with Bea. Her style is much more **efficient** — you can see more places in a **short period of time** and have a **richer** experience.

当我更年轻的时候，我想我会更喜欢和 Bea 一起去旅行。她的风格高效得多——在很短的时间内可以看更多地方，体验更丰富。

### Practice History

**Would you prefer to go on a tour with Lin or with Bea? Why?**

> Corrections:

1. “having a tour is **for relaxation**” sounds awkward; a more natural phrase is “a tour should be relaxing” or “a tour is meant for relaxation.”
2. “**tourist sites**” is correct but “tourist attractions” is more natural in this context.

I would prefer to go on a tour with Lin. In my opinion, **a tour is meant for relaxation**. I don't want to visit all the **tourist attractions** in a hurry and be exhausted. If I want to get general information, I can check online.

---

**By visiting** sites with **relaxation**, we can **experience** nature and culture.

I would prefer to go on a tour with Lin. I like a more relaxed **tour**, **rather than** trying to see as **many** tourist sites as possible. If we want to learn about the **tourist sites**, it's convenient to check all the information online, **so** we don't need to exhaust **ourselves**. **By visiting** sites **in** a more **relaxed** way, we can better **experience** nature and culture.

---

I would prefer to go on a tour with Lin. As for **relaxation**, Lin is really an expert. And for **holidays**, I don't want it **to be** too tense, just **relaxed**.

> Corrections:

1. “As for relaxation” and “And for holidays” are a bit redundant together; sentence structure could be more natural.
2. “I don’t want it to be too tense, just relaxed” is grammatically okay but could be smoother in style.

I would prefer to go on a tour with Lin. She is truly an expert when it **comes to relaxation**. **During** holidays, I don’t want **things** to be too **tense** — I just want to **relax**.

我更愿意和 Lin 一起旅行。她在放松方面真的很在行。假期时，我不想太紧张，只想轻松一下。

When I was still young, I would prefer to go on a tour with Bea. Bea's style is more effective, you can follow her visit more sites in a limited time and experience more.

> Corrections:

1. “When I was still young” → more natural to say “When I was **younger**.”
2. “would prefer” → since you are talking about the past, “**would have preferred**” fits better.
3. “effective” → in this context, “efficient” is more precise (**effective** = achieving goals; **efficient** = doing it quickly and with fewer resources, which fits your meaning).
4. Added em dash in your preferred style (with spaces before and after).

When I was **younger**, I **would have preferred** to go on a tour with Bea. Bea’s style is more **efficient** — you can follow her to visit more sites in a limited time and experience more.

当我更年轻的时候，我会更想和 Bea 一起去旅行。Bea 的风格更高效——跟着她能在有限的时间内参观更多景点、体验更多。
