# Building a Fort - B3

Eddy is in the living room, stretching on a yoga mat.

Junior walks in and watches him.

- **Junior**: Dad, what are you doing?
- **Eddy**: Stretching! It's good for your muscles and keeps you flexible.
- **Junior**: Hmm… I want to stretch too.
- **Eddy**: Wait, seriously? You want to?
- **Junior**: Yes, I was thinking about my health. I should be more flexible.
- **Eddy**: That's awesome! Stretching is super important.
  - OK, sit down here. We'll start with touching our toes.
- **Junior**: Great idea! But, um, I'll need your yoga mat for this.
- **Eddy**: Of course! This mat is perfect for stretching.

Eddy steps aside, and Junior picks up the yoga mat.

- **Junior**: Actually, I'll use it over here… by the couch.
- **Eddy**: By the couch? Why? Aren't we stretching together?
- **Junior**: Oh, no! I read it's better to stretch alone for focus.
- **Eddy**: Hmm… well, OK. Let me know if you need help.

Eddy goes to the kitchen. A few minutes later, he peeks into the living room.

Junior is not stretching.

Instead, Junior is building a fort with the yoga mat, cushions, and chairs.

- **Eddy**: Junior! What's going on?
- **Junior**: Oh, um, I figured out I'm not great at stretching.
  - But this fort? Way more fun and good for my health… I think.
- **Eddy**: Junior, you're unbelievable!

**Why did Junior want the yoga mat?**

Junior wanted the yoga mat because he needed it to build a fort, which was part of a fun little project he had **in mind**. Instead of telling the truth, he told Eddy that he needed it for stretching — probably thinking that reason would **sound** more believable. In reality, though, his main goal was to **get materials** for his fort. This shows how creative kids can be, even if it means being a little **sneaky** to get what they want.

Junior 想要那个瑜伽垫，是因为他打算用它来搭建一个堡垒，这是他心里计划的一项有趣小项目。但他没有说实话，而是告诉 Eddy 自己是为了拉伸需要这个垫子 — 可能觉得这样更容易被相信。实际上，他真正的目标是为自己的堡垒准备材料。这显示出孩子们的创造力，即使有时他们会小小地撒个谎来实现自己的愿望。
