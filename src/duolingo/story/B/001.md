# Baby Bird - B2

Lucy finds her granddaughter, Lin, giving a baby bird a bath in the kitchen sink.

- **Lucy**: Lin, I know you want to help that bird, but you should take it to a vet.
- **Lin**: Her name is Birdie, Grandma, and she's still learning how to fly. I'm teaching her.
- **Lucy**: Why do you care so much about this bird?
- **Lin**: Because she reminds me of me! We both love free food.

Lucy points to an empty bag of potato chips.

- **Lucy**: Did you eat those? Those weren't free. I paid for them!
- **Lin**: Birdie ate them!

Lucy stares at Lin, who's clearly lying.

- **Lin**: OK, it was me… but Birdie ate the **crumbs**!

Lucy notices feathers all over the living room couch.

- **Lucy**: My couch is covered in feathers!
- **Lin**: That's Birdie's bed. Like me, she loves to watch TV.
- **Lucy**: OK, we need to take **Birdie** to a professional who can take care of her.
- **Lin**: But we can't pressure her to leave her new home! Before I let her go, she needs to be prepared!
- **Lucy**: If you spoil her, she'll never be independent.
  - She'll just hang around the apartment, eating my potato chips, sleeping on my couch, and making a mess!
- **Lin**: If you don't want us here, I'll take Birdie and leave.

Suddenly, Birdie flies out the open window. Lin watches in shock.

- **Lin**: Whoa, I guess she could fly after all.
- **Lucy**: Finally!
- **Lin**: I'm so proud to see my baby fly away.
- **Lucy**: I wish I knew what that felt like.

The next morning, Lin and Lucy find Birdie by their window.

- **Lucy**: Lin! You spoiled the bird so much that she came back for food!
- **Lin**: That makes me think…
- **Lucy**: About moving out?
- **Lin**: No, about breakfast! Can you make pancakes for me and Birdie?

### Practice History

**Why did Lin want to keep Birdie?**

Lin wanted/ felt connected / alike

Lin wanted to keep Birdie because she felt connected with the bird, she felt they are alike, they both loved free food.

> Corrections:

1. “connected with” → 更自然的搭配是 “connected to”（表示情感或心理上的连接）
2. “they are alike” → 改为过去时 “they were alike” 以保持时态一致
3. “they both loved” → 更自然地重写为 “both of them loved…” 用分号分开两个分句增强清晰度

Lin wanted to keep Birdie because she felt connected to the bird — she **thought** they **were** alike; both of them **loved** free food.

Lin 想留下 Birdie 是因为她觉得和这只鸟有连接感 — 她觉得他们很像，两者都喜欢免费的食物。
