# Bad Monkey

Eddy and Junior are looking at the monkeys at the zoo. Suddenly, Eddy **hears** Junior **shout**.

- **Junior**: Stop! Thief!
- **Eddy**: Junior, what's wrong?
- **Junior**: That monkey stole the candy that I had in my pocket!
- **Eddy**: Ha, ha, you have a great imagination! But a monkey didn't take your candy.
- **Junior**: He did take my candy. Look at him!

The **monkey** smiles at Eddy.

- **Eddy**: He looks like a happy monkey.
- **Junior**: Yeah, he's happy because he ate my candy.

Eddy looks at his phone for a minute. The monkey throws a candy wrapper at Junior. Junior picks it up.

- **Eddy**: Ha! If the monkey took your candy, then why do you have the wrapper?
- **Junior**: The monkey threw it at me! He wants me to get in trouble.

The zookeeper walks over.

- **Zookeeper**: Did this monkey do something to you?
- **Junior**: Yes! He stole my candy!
- **Zookeeper**: Oh yes. He does that a lot.
- **Eddy**: He does?
- **Zookeeper**: Yes, he looks cute, but — ouch!

The monkey is throwing rocks at the zookeeper's head. The monkey starts to laugh.

- **Zookeeper**: He's the worst monkey that we've ever had at this zoo.
- **Junior**: I knew it!
- **Zookeeper**: I hate this monkey.
  - He did a terrible thing **to** my favorite hat.

The zookeeper and the monkey look at each other. The monkey steals the zookeeper's hat and runs away.

- **Zookeeper**: My hat! Not again!

The zookeeper **chases** the monkey.

- **Junior**: Do you see, Dad? I wasn't lying.
- **Eddy**: Wow, I'm sorry that I didn't believe you, Junior. I'll buy you some more candy.

Eddy looks for his wallet.

- **Eddy**: That's strange... I can't find my wallet.
- **Junior**: I think I know who took it...

## Sentences

- Eddy and Junior are looking at the monkeys at the zoo. Suddenly, Eddy hears Junior **shout**.
  - Eddy hears Junior ~~shouts~~.
  - Rule: After **verbs of perception** like `hear`, `see`, `watch`, `feel`, we usually use:
    - **bare infinitive** (no **-s**, no **to**) → e.g., **shout**, **cry**, **run**
    - OR **present participle** (ending in **-ing**) → e.g., **shouting**, **crying**, **running**

| Structure                     | Example                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **hear + object + base verb** | I heard him **laugh**.    |
| **hear + object + verb-ing**  | I heard him **laughing**. |

Bonus comparison:

- **Eddy hears Junior shout.** → complete action
- **Eddy hears Junior shouting.** → ongoing or in progress

Is **“mischievous”** positive or negative?

✅ Neutral to mildly negative — but often playful

Mischievous describes someone (often a child or animal) who causes small trouble or plays tricks in a playful, not harmful, way.

It’s not usually seriously negative — more lighthearted, cheeky, or naughty.

💡 Examples:

- A mischievous child might hide your shoes as a joke.
- The puppy looked mischievous as it chewed on the slipper.

In your case (the monkey)

Mischievous fits if you want to give the monkey a playful, naughty image (causing small trouble but not truly bad).

If you want to emphasize that the monkey’s actions were bad or annoying, you could use:

- naughty (mildly negative)
- troublesome (more negative)
- bad (simple, clearly negative)

### Practice History

**Why does the zookeeper hate the monkey?**

The zookeeper / ruined his / causes trouble

The **zookeeper** hates the **monkey** because it did terrible things to the zookeeper's favorite hat and caused lots of ~~troubles~~.

> Corrections:

1. “troubles” → should be trouble (uncountable in this context: “cause trouble” not “troubles”)

The **zookeeper** hates the **monkey** because it did terrible things to the zookeeper’s favorite hat and caused lots of **trouble**.

饲养员讨厌那只猴子，因为它对他最喜欢的帽子做了可怕的事，还惹了很多麻烦。

**What happened in this story?**

> Corrections:

1. “misunderstanding with Junior”
   - → better phrased as **“misunderstanding with Junior”** is acceptable, but **“make it up to Junior”** sounds more natural here
2. Repetition of **“it was true”**
   - → fine, though could also say **“the zookeeper confirmed it”** for brevity.

In the story, there was a bad monkey who **stole** Junior's candy. Eddy didn’t believe it until a zookeeper confirmed that **it** was true. Eddy **tried** to **make it up to** Junior by buying candy for him, but he found his wallet was missing — it was probably the monkey again.

故事中，有一只调皮的猴子偷了 Junior 的糖果。Eddy 一开始不相信，直到管理员证实这是真的。为了弥补对 Junior 的误解，Eddy 想买糖果给他，但他发现钱包不见了——很可能又是那只猴子干的。

> Corrections:

1. “who stole Junior’s candy” → for animals, that is preferred over who in formal English.
2. “buying candy for him” → smoother as buying him some candy (more natural phrasing).
3. Added then before “he found” → improves the sequence flow.

In the story, there was a bad monkey **that stole** Junior’s candy. Eddy didn’t believe it until a zookeeper confirmed that it was true. Eddy tried to make it up to Junior by **buying him some candy**, but then he found that his wallet was missing — it was probably the monkey again.
