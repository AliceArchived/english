# Buying Art on a Budget - B2

An **excerpt** from "Oscar's Guide to a Life Worth Living"

Even at the finest art galleries, negotiation is expected. If you're on a budget, here are some tricks for negotiating with confidence.

**Dress like an expert.**

Vendors will believe you're an expert if you dress like one, and then it'll be easier to persuade them to lower their prices.

Always wear freshly ironed dress pants - never jeans. And remember to bring your fancy glasses. Nothing says "expert" quite like a **monocle**.

**Bring a friend.**

When you're buying art, it's good to bring a friend who can support your arguments for a lower price.

I make sure my friend Lucy agrees with me very loudly when I talk about how overpriced a piece of art is.

She'll say things like, "How much!? I could start a new life with that much money!"

Don't be afraid to lie.

Even if a painting is so beautiful that you could cry, pretend it's just ordinary.

Mention seeing something "just like it" in a restaurant bathroom or **exclaim**, "I could create better art myself!" But never demonstrate - this didn't end well for me in a past experience.

All of that said, don't try these tricks with me.

As a respected artist, I know the value of my work, so I'll never be tricked by a **monocle**!
