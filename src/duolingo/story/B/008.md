# Bea's Date

Bea walks into a restaurant. She's meeting someone for a first date.

- **Bea**: Hi! Are you Nadia?
- **Nadia**: Oh. Yes. You must be Bea.
- **Bea**: Yes! Nice to meet you! Have you been to this restaurant before?
- **Nadia**: I used to eat here often. I stopped coming after I saw a man die here.
- **Bea**: Um, oh.
- **Nadia**: But their **tacos** are alright.
- **Bea**: Wow, OK.
  - Have you seen any good movies lately?
- **Nadia**: I don't watch movies. They're boring.
- **Bea**: Oh... then you probably like to read.
- **Nadia**: Books? Ew. No. They're like movies that I have to carry.
- **Bea**: Uh... do you like to cook?
- **Nadia**: No, I like when people cook for me.
- **Bea**: OK... So... tell me about yourself.
- **Nadia**: No, not on a first date. I like to wait until we know each other better.
- **Bea**: Oh... do you go on a lot of dates?
- **Nadia**: I go on a lot of first dates ... but not many second dates. I don't know why.
- **Bea**: I might know why.
  - I think I'm going to go.

Bea stands up to leave, but then she sees a woman.

- **Bea**: Oh no! It's my ex-girlfriend.

Nadia looks at the woman.

- **Nadia**: Oh no! It's my ex-girlfriend!
- **Bea**: You dated Melissa?
- **Nadia**: Yes! She's terrible! She sneezes so loudly!
- **Bea**: I know!
- **Nadia**: And if you don't laugh at her jokes, she says them again, but louder.
- **Bea**: That's very true!
  - Maybe we do have some things in common. Do you want to order dinner?
- **Nadia**: No. You seem a little negative.
  - I don't date negative people.
