# Bea the Photographer

Bea and Eddy are sitting outside a cafe in front of a large fountain.

- **Bea**: My job isn't **fulfilling**. I just want to make a few films, win many awards, and get famous. Is that too much to ask?
- **Eddy**: Yeah, I know what you mean. I just want to play sports all day.
- **Bea**: Eddy, you're a gym teacher, remember?
- **Eddy**: Yeah. My job's great!

Two tourists with a camera approach Eddy and hand him a camera.

- **Tourists**: Excuse me, sir. Could you take our photo in front of that fountain?
- **Eddy**: Uh, sure —
- **Bea**: I'll do it! I'm a professional filmmaker, so I'll take better photos than him.

Bea takes the camera from Eddy. She directs the tourists to sit on a **bench** in front of the fountain.

The tourists put their arms around each other and smile.

- **Bea**: Don't smile. Smiling makes you look like tourists.
- **Tourists**: But we are tourists.
- **Bea**: Don't look at the camera! Look up at the sky, and pretend you're thinking deeply about something.
- **Tourists**: But the sun is hurting my eyes.
- **Bea**: Don't move! The lighting is perfect.

Bea kneels down and aims the camera at a puddle **on** the ground.

- **Tourists**: What are you doing? You're not even aiming the camera at us…
- **Bea**: I'm photographing your reflection in the puddle. It's artistic!

Bea takes several photos and gives the camera back to the tourists.

- **Tourists**: We asked for a picture with the fountain. It's not even in these photos…
- **Bea**: Those photos were incredible! Maybe I should be a photographer instead of a filmmaker.

The tourists approach Eddy.

- **Tourists**: Will you take our picture instead? And can you make sure to include the fountain?
- **Eddy**: Well… I'm not a professional, but sure!

Eddy takes a single photo and hands the camera back to the tourists.

- **Tourists**: Perfect! Thanks.

- **Eddy**: Bea, they loved my photo! Maybe I could be a photographer too. We could start a business together!

- **Bea**: Nobody appreciates art.

## Sentences

**What was your favorite part of the story? Why?**

My favorite part of the story was when Bea told the tourists not to smile because smiling would make them look like tourists — even though they clearly were tourists. I found this moment especially humorous because Bea's overly artistic instructions, like directing them to look thoughtfully at the sky or capturing their reflection in a puddle, completely ignored the tourists' simple request for a typical photo with the fountain. This ironic **contrast** between Bea’s **exaggerated** seriousness and the tourists' genuine confusion made the scene both amusing and memorable for me.

我最喜欢故事里 Bea 告诉游客不要笑的那一段，她说笑会让他们看起来像游客，而实际上他们就是游客。我觉得这个场景尤其好笑，因为 Bea 给出的那些过于艺术化的指导，例如让游客凝视天空，假装在沉思，或者特意去拍地上水坑里的倒影，完全忽视了游客只是想拍一张普通喷泉照的请求。这种 Bea 夸张的认真态度与游客真切困惑之间的反差，使得这一幕既幽默又令人印象深刻。

### Practice History

**What was your favorite part of the story? Why?**

My favorite part was when Bea took **a** picture for the tourists and asked them not to **smile**. Bea said smiling made them look like tourists, but they were actually tourists. That was funny.

> Corrections:

1. "took a picture for the tourists" should be "took a picture of the tourists". "Take a picture of someone" means photographing them; "for" means doing them a favor (which changes the meaning).

My favorite part was when Bea took **a picture** **of** the tourists and asked them not to smile. Bea said smiling made them look like **tourists** — but they were actually tourists, **which was funny**.

我最喜欢的部分是比娅给游客拍照时，让他们不要笑。比娅说笑会让他们看起来像游客，但实际上他们本来就是游客，这一点很有趣。

My favorite part was when Bea didn't follow the tourists requirements and finally complained nobody appreciates arts. If it's a business, understanding customers requirements is a basic skill, it's not what we like, it's about what clients like.
