# Beach Day

Oscar is driving with his cousin, Orson.

- **Oscar**: I'm so glad that I came to visit you.
- **Orson**: Yeah, I thought you were only visiting for two days….
- **Oscar**: Me too! But I've been here for three weeks!
  - I hated Los Angeles when I arrived, but I've really enjoyed living in your tiny apartment.
  - Now I even enjoy the traffic and your strange, healthy food.
- **Orson**: I know. You ate everything in my refrigerator.
- **Oscar**: I really liked going to all those fancy restaurants too.
- **Orson**: Yes, and now I don't have any money. That's why I made sandwiches today!

**Orson parks his car by the beach.**

- **Orson**: Surprise! We're eating lunch here.
- **Oscar**: But I hate the beach!

**They get out of the car.**

- **Orson**: I love the beach. Now that it's summer, we'll come here every day!
- **Oscar**: But I hate sand, and the ocean water is too salty. It hurts my eyes.
  - I always hated the beach when we were kids! Don't you remember?
- **Orson**: Just try to enjoy it.

**They sit down on a towel and take out the sandwiches.**

- **Oscar**: But I didn't bring any sunscreen. Look! My face is already burning!

**A seagull lands on the towel and steals Oscar's sandwich.**

- **Oscar**: My sandwich! What am I going to eat now?

**A beach ball hits Oscar's face.**

- **Oscar**: Ow!

**A kid splashes water into Oscar's eyes.**

- **Oscar**: It's so salty! It hurts my eyes!
- **Orson**: Oh no. Let's go back to my apartment to take care of your eyes.
  - We'll be there in two hours … because of traffic.
- **Oscar**: I hate Los Angeles!
  - I'm going home tomorrow!
