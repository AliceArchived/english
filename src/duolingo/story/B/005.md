# Bargaining Lessons - B3

Lin and Lucy are sitting on the couch surrounded by bags from the flea market.

- **Lin**: Grandma, how do you get such low prices at the market? I tried, but I'm terrible at bargaining.
- **Lucy**: Bargaining is a skill, Lin. It's something you learn with experience.
- **Lin**: OK, then teach me. What's the perfect strategy?
- **Lucy**: Hmm… Well, first, you have to act like the item isn't special.
- **Lin**: OK, like, "This vase is low quality"?
- **Lucy**: No, not that rude! Just… less interested.
- **Lin**: Got it. What's next?
- **Lucy**: Then, you ask for a lower price.
- **Lin**: That's it? That's your magic technique?
- **Lucy**: Well, there's one more thing.
- **Lin**: What? Tell me!
- **Lucy**: You need a story.
- **Lin**: A story?
- **Lucy**: Yes. Something exciting to get the seller's attention.
- **Lin**: Like what?
- **Lucy**: Hmm… I tell them I used to work in a circus.
- **Lin**: Wait, you never worked in a circus.
- **Lucy**: Of course not! But they believe me.
- **Lin**: And that works?
- **Lucy**: Always! People give me great deals for my "amazing" stories.
- **Lin**: Grandma, that's not bargaining. That's… lying.
- **Lucy**: It's creative bargaining.
- **Lin**: So, should I tell people I'm a circus performer, too?
- **Lucy**: No, Lin. You'd make a terrible performer.
- **Lin**: Thanks, Grandma. I feel super confident now.

# 讨价还价课 - B3

Lin 和 Lucy 坐在沙发上，周围堆满了从跳蚤市场买来的购物袋。

- **Lin**：奶奶，你怎么能在市场上讲到这么低的价格？我也试过，但我完全不会讨价还价。
- **Lucy**：Lin，讨价还价是一门技巧，是靠经验学来的。
- **Lin**：好吧，那你教教我。有没有什么完美的策略？
- **Lucy**：嗯……首先，你得装作这东西没什么特别的。
- **Lin**：比如说，“这个花瓶质量很差”？
- **Lucy**：不，不要那么无礼！只是……表现得没那么感兴趣。
- **Lin**：明白了。然后呢？
- **Lucy**：然后你就提出一个更低的价格。
- **Lin**：就这样？这就是你的必杀技？
- **Lucy**：嗯，其实还有一招。
- **Lin**：什么？快告诉我！
- **Lucy**：你需要一个故事。
- **Lin**：一个故事？
- **Lucy**：对。讲点有趣的事吸引卖家的注意。
- **Lin**：比如说？
- **Lucy**：嗯……我通常会说我以前在马戏团工作过。
- **Lin**：等等，你根本没在马戏团工作过啊。
- **Lucy**：当然没有！但他们信了。
- **Lin**：这也有效？
- **Lucy**：每次都有效！人们会因为我这些“精彩”的故事给我好价钱。
- **Lin**：奶奶，那不是讨价还价，那是……撒谎。
- **Lucy**：那是有创意的讨价还价。
- **Lin**：那我是不是也该说我是马戏团表演者？
- **Lucy**：不，Lin。你当表演者肯定不行。
- **Lin**：谢谢你啊，奶奶。我现在信心爆棚了。
