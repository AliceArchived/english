# Bad Reception

Eddy and Oscar are in Oscar's apartment. They are watching a soccer game on TV.

- **Eddy**: Yes! Amazing!
  - Did you see that goal?
- **Oscar**: No. Eddy, you asked to come into my apartment for one minute to check the score.
  - But you've been here an hour!
- **Eddy**: I know. Aren't you glad I stayed?
- **Oscar**: Eddy, I am very tired.
- **Eddy**: Some pizza will wake you up.
- **Oscar**: No, it's too late for pizza!
- **Eddy**: Don't worry! I know an amazing pizza place that's open late.

Eddy takes out his phone.

- **Eddy**: Hmm. I don't have any **reception**. Does your phone have reception?

Oscar looks at his phone. It has great reception.

- **Oscar**: No, sorry.
  - But there's good reception near my front door.

Eddy walks over to the door.

- **Eddy**: There's still no reception here.
- **Oscar**: Can you try walking out the door?
- **Eddy**: You want me to go into the hall?
- **Oscar**: Yes! The reception is great there.

Eddy opens the door and walks out of the apartment.

- **Eddy**: There is great reception in the hall!

Oscar runs to the door, shuts it quickly, and locks it.

- **Oscar**: He's finally gone!

Oscar's phone rings.

Oscar answers his phone. It's Eddy calling from the hall.

- **Eddy**: Oscar? Your door is locked. Can you let me in?
- **Oscar**: Sorry, I can't hear you. I have bad reception.
