# Super Qualified - B2

Lucy walks into her living room and smiles proudly as she shows her granddaughter Lin a job post on her phone.

- **Lucy:** I think I might've finally found the perfect job for you - security guard!
- **Lin:** Say more…
- **Lucy:** It involves sitting for long periods of time, so you're super qualified!
- **Lin:** I don't know… That still sounds like a lot of work.
- **Lucy:** That's what a job is, Lin.
- **Lin:** But I just want to have fun.
- **Lucy:** Listen, if you get this job, I'll take us on a road trip. We'll go next week!
- **Lin:** Really? You'll pay for hotel, gas, and my favorite **cheesy crackers**?
- **Lucy:** Yes.

The next day, Lucy drives Lin to the interview. Lin is wearing a formal but **ill-fitting** suit.

- **Lin:** Grandma, I hate this suit. I don't look like myself.
- **Lucy:** That's the point! If you dressed like you usually do, you wouldn't get the job. But in my old suit, you look professional!

Lucy hands Lin a folder.

- **Lucy:** I made this resume for you since your last one was written on a napkin.
- **Lin:** Great! Now what kind of car are we renting for our road trip? A **convertible**?
- **Lucy:** Whatever you want, as long as you get the job.
- **Lin:** Wish me luck!

After the interview, Lin races to meet Lucy in the parking lot.

- **Lin:** I got the job! They were very impressed by your suit and the resume you made.
- **Lucy:** Seriously?! When do you start working?
- **Lin:** Actually, I turned it down. They wanted me to start on Monday, but that's when we're going on our road trip!

## Writing

### Do you think Lin would've been a good security guard? Why or why not?

I believe that Lin won't be a good security guard. Yes, she likes sitting down for a long time, but only for watching TV, ~~watching~~ the monitor is ~~much~~ boring, I don't think she can do it well.

I believe that Lin won't be a good security guard. Yes, she likes sitting down for a long time, but only for watching TV. **Watching** the monitor is much **more** boring. I don't think she can do it.

> - **"Watching the monitor is much more boring."** – grammatically correct, but can be improved stylistically. "More boring" is okay, but a more natural phrase is **"even more boring"** or **"far more boring."**

I believe Lin wouldn't make a good security guard. Sure, she likes sitting for long periods — but only **when** she's watching TV. **Staring at a monitor is far more boring**, and I don't think she could **handle** it.
