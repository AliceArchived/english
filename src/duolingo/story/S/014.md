# Summer Sweater

Eddy and Junior are at the mall.

- **Junior**: Dad, why are we here? You hate this store.
- **Eddy**: I need a sweater.
- **Junior**: But it's summer.

A salesperson **walks up to** them.

- **Salesperson**: Hi again, Eddy!
- **Eddy**: Yes, my name is Eddy. I mean … hello!
- **Junior**: Oh. I know why we're here …
- **Salesperson**: Can I help you find something?
- **Eddy**: Yes! I'm looking for a sweater.
- **Salesperson**: You should try on this green sweater. It'**s going to** look good on you.
- **Eddy**: Cool, thanks!
- **Junior**: You don't like green.
- **Eddy**: Shh. No. I love green!

Eddy puts on the sweater.

- **Junior**: It looks too small, Dad.
- **Eddy**: What? No.
- **Salesperson**: And it's on sale.
- **Eddy**: It'll take it!
  - And … I'm going to wear it home.
- **Salesperson**: Great! Have a nice day! I hope I see you again soon!
- **Eddy**: Really?
- **Junior**: Let's go, Dad.

Eddy and Junior leave the store.

- **Junior**: Dad, are you sure you're OK? Your face is blue.
- **Eddy**: I'm fine!
- **Junior**: You can't take the sweater off, can you?
- **Eddy**: No.
- **Junior**: Let's go buy **some scissors**.
