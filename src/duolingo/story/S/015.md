# Surprise Party

Lily and Zari see Vikram buying balloons in a store.

- **Zari**: Hi, Vikram. Nice balloons!
- **Vikram**: Thanks, it's my wife's birthday. I'm having a surprise party for her.
- **Zari**: But Priti is here!
- **Lily**: We just saw her in the store.
- **Vikram**: Oh no! She left work early? If she sees me, the party won't be a surprise.
  - Can you **distract** Priti?
  - I need to go home and set up the party.
- **Lily**: Sure, we'll help you.

Zari and Lily find Priti holding a bottle of shampoo.

- **Lily**: Hi Priti! Do you use that shampoo?
- **Priti**: Oh, hi! Yes, I do.
- **Lily**: I heard that it has dangerous chemicals in it.
- **Priti**: But it's organic.
- **Lily**: You should read the ingredients.
- **Zari**: Yeah, and you should look up all the ingredients on your phone… right now…
- **Priti**: I don't have time for that. I'm going home.

Priti walks away.

- **Zari**: She can't go home yet! Vikram needs more time.

Priti walks out of the store. Lily and Zari quickly run over to her. Lily is holding a wallet.

- **Lily**: Priti! You dropped your wallet.
- **Priti**: That's not mine.
- **Zari**: Uh… she **meant** your keys!

Zari **pulls** keys **out** of her pocket.

- **Priti**: Those aren't my keys.

Priti tries to walk away, and Zari runs in front of her and falls on the ground.

- **Zari**: Ow!
- **Priti**: Zari, are you OK?
- **Zari**: No, I feel really sick!

Zari pretends to faint.

- **Lily**: Oh no. Please help her.

Priti looks at Zari and Lily. She thinks for a moment.

- **Priti**: OK. I'll call an ambulance.

Zari sits up.

- **Zari**: Don't call an ambulance!
- **Lily**: Look, she's feeling better now.
- **Priti**: OK, you're both being silly, and I don't have time.
  - My husband is having a surprise party for me, and I can't be late.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Do you like surprise parties? Why?**

No, I’m **not really a fan of** surprise parties. To be honest, no one has ever thrown a surprise party for me. Maybe when I was younger, I **would have enjoyed it** if someone had done that. But now, I prefer everything to be planned **in advance** so I can **feel in control of** the situation.

不，我其实并不喜欢惊喜派对。说实话，从来没有人给我办过惊喜派对。也许在我年轻的时候，如果有人给我办过，我会很开心。但现在，我更喜欢一切都提前安排好，这样我会觉得更安心，更有掌控感。

### Practice History

**Do you like surprise parties? Why?**

No, I don’t like **surprise parties**. Actually, no one has ever **thrown** a surprise party for me. Maybe when I was younger, if someone **had thrown** a surprise party for me, I would have been happy. But now, I prefer things **to happen** under control.

> Corrections:

1. **“surprise party”** → 应为 **复数**：“surprise parties”，因前面用了 **like**（泛指）。
2. **“no one ever hold”** → 时态错误，应为 **“has ever held”**（现在完成时）。
3. **“had held”** 和 **“I would be happy”** 的虚拟语气结构不匹配，应为 **“I would have been happy”**。
4. **“things happened under control”** → 时态搭配不自然，建议改为 **“I prefer things to happen under control”** 或 **“I like things to be planned”**。
5. “held a surprise party” 可以用 “thrown a surprise party”，这是更常用、更自然的搭配。

No, I don't like **surprise parties**. Actually, no one has ever **held** a surprise party for me. Maybe when I was younger, if someone **had thrown** a surprise party for me, I would **have been happy**. But now, I **prefer** things **to happen** under control.

不，我不喜欢惊喜派对。其实从来没有人为我办过惊喜派对。也许在我小时候，如果有人为我办过，我会很开心。但现在，我更喜欢事情在掌控之中。

更自然的表达版本也可以是：

I don’t really enjoy surprise parties. I’ve never had one myself, and maybe I would have liked it when I was younger. But now, I prefer things to be planned and under control.
