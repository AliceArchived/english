# Sorry I'm Late

Eddy arrives at a restaurant. He talks to the waiter.

- **Eddy**: Hi, I'm meeting someone here for a date, and I'm late! Have you seen her?

A woman waves to him.

- **Eddy**: Hi! I'm Eddy. So sorry I'm late!
- **Woman**: That's OK. Let's begin.

Eddy sits down. He notices the woman is wearing a very nice suit.

- **Eddy**: You look nice.
  - I should have worn a suit too!
- **Woman**: Yes, and you should have worn a tie.
- **Eddy**: Next time, I'll remember that you like ties.
- **Woman**: Let's hurry. I only have twenty minutes.
- **Eddy**: Only twenty minutes?!
- **Woman**: That should be enough time.
- **Eddy**: You're right. My parents were in love the first minute they saw each other.
- **Woman**: Interesting. So, tell me about your job.
- **Eddy**: I teach gym at the high school.
- **Woman**: You must be good with kids.
- **Eddy**: I should tell you… I have an eight-year-old son.
- **Woman**: That's OK!
- **Eddy**: Really? I'm so glad you said that! Maybe I can introduce you to him…
- **Woman**: I don't think that's necessary.
  - Tell me about your skills.
- **Eddy**: I'm very good at making romantic dinners.
- **Woman**: No, I want to know about your job skills.
- **Eddy**: Do you always talk about work so much on a first date?
- **Woman**: This isn't a date. It's a job interview.

Eddy looks at his phone.

- **Eddy**: Oh no! This is the wrong appointment. I thought you were my date. You're…
- **Woman**: I'm Liz, from the gym downtown. We are hiring a manager to work at night and on weekends.
- **Eddy**: So, can I have the job?
- **Woman**: Definitely not.
- **Eddy**: Well, now my nights and weekends are free for dates!

### What happened in this story? Tell us.

In the story, Eddy meets Liz and he thinks she is his date, but actually Liz is interviewing someone for a gym manager. They both meet the wrong person.

> - “**he thinks she is his date**” → 虽然语法正确，但上下文更自然的是 “he **thinks she’s his date**”
> - “**interviewing someone for a gym manager**” → 搭配错误，应为 “**interviewing candidates for a gym manager position**” 或更简洁地说 “**interviewing for a gym manager**”
> - “**They both meet the wrong person**.” → 语法正确，但时态与上文不一致（建议统一使用现在时，讲故事更自然）

#### What happened in this story? (Present tense retelling)

In the story, Eddy arrives at a restaurant and tells the waiter that he’s meeting someone for a date — but he’s late. A woman **waves** to him, and Eddy **assumes** she’s his date. He quickly sits down, apologizes, and starts chatting with her.

At first, the woman seems a bit serious, but Eddy tries to be charming. He compliments her suit and jokes about not wearing a tie. She says she only has twenty minutes, which **surprises** Eddy, but he goes along with it.

As they talk, Eddy shares that he’s a gym teacher at a high school and even mentions that he has an eight-year-old son. He thinks everything is going well — until the woman suddenly asks about his job skills. Eddy is confused and asks, “Do you always talk about work this much on a first date?” That’s when she tells him this isn’t a date — it’s actually a **job interview**.

Eddy is shocked. He looks at his phone and realizes he **mixed up** his appointments. The woman **introduces** herself **as** Liz, from the downtown gym, and says they’re hiring a manager to work evenings and weekends. Eddy asks if he can still get the job. She firmly says no. Eddy **laughs** it **off** and says, “Well, now my nights and weekends are free for dates!”

在这个故事中，Eddy 到餐厅后告诉服务员他要见一个约会对象，但他迟到了。这时一个女士向他招手，Eddy 就以为她是他要见的人。他立刻坐下来道歉，并开始和她聊天。

一开始，这位女士显得有点严肃，但 Eddy 试图用幽默让气氛轻松。他夸她穿得很正式，还调侃自己没打领带。女士说她只有二十分钟时间，Eddy 很惊讶，但还是继续配合。

他们谈话时，Eddy 说自己是高中体育老师，还提到他有个八岁的儿子。他觉得两人相处得不错，结果对方突然开始问他职业技能。他一脸懵，问她：“你第一次约会就聊这么多工作吗？”这时女士才告诉他：**这根本不是约会，是一场面试**。

Eddy 大吃一惊。他看了一眼手机，才发现自己搞错了约见对象。女士自我介绍说她是市中心那家健身房的 Liz，正在招聘晚上和周末班的经理。Eddy 还问她自己能不能应聘。她直接拒绝。Eddy 只好自嘲说：“那我现在晚上和周末都空出来了，可以去约会啦！”

**laugh off something** = **用笑的方式轻描淡写地处理某事**， 通常指**不把尴尬、批评或失败当回事**，用笑一笑的方式“化解”局面。
