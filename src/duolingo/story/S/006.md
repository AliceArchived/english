# Selecting Movies for Babysitting - B2

An **excerpt** from "Oscar's Guide to a Life Worth Living"

In the past, I never understood why parents allowed children to watch so much TV. Now I know that a good movie is the most effective babysitter ever.

However, it's difficult to find a movie that will keep a child entertained without making the adults run out of the room screaming.

That's why I came up with the following tips, in case I'm ever **stuck** babysitting Eddy's son, Junior, again.

While you may want kids to appreciate classic films, never play one for a child.

If a movie is in black and white, then children will ask questions like, "Can old people only see in black and white?"

Also, never play a silent film because the child will then make up their own silly dialogue or add ridiculous sound effects.

The mysterious truth is that kids actually prefer movies with singing animals, talking vehicles, and orphans who solve problems with magic - especially if they're all in one movie.

Ultimately, my recommendation is to **compromise** by playing the least annoying option — one of the "Space Viking" films.

I used to have no interest in these movies, but I was surprised to find that they're actually delightful.

It's true that the plots make no sense, but these movies are worth watching — if not just for the fabulous space costumes.

Put one of these movies on, and the end result will be hours of free time for you.

## Sentences

- 然而，很难找到一部既能让孩子开心又不会让大人崩溃逃离房间的电影。
  - However, it's difficult to find a movie that will keep a child entertained without making the adults run out of the room screaming.
- 这就是为什么我想出了以下建议，以防我哪天又不得不照看埃迪的儿子小埃迪。
  - That's why I came up with the following tips, in case I'm ever stuck babysitting Eddy's son, Junior, again.
  - "Stuck" in this context means trapped in an unwanted or difficult situation with no easy way out. The speaker feels that babysitting Junior is not something they enjoy or choose willingly, and if it happens again, they might feel forced or unable to avoid it.

**Why should you avoid showing kids black-and-white movies?**

I think it’s better to avoid showing kids black-and-white movies because they might start asking **confusing** or **awkward** questions like, “Can old people only see in black and white?” It can be **difficult** to explain and could **lead to** unnecessary misunderstandings.

我觉得最好避免给孩子看黑白电影，因为他们可能会问一些让人困惑或尴尬的问题，比如：“老人是不是只能看到黑白的？” 这种问题可能不好解释，还可能引起不必要的误解。
