# Second Place - B2

Oscar and his friend Lucy go to an art museum for a party celebrating a collection of paintings by Nina, an old classmate of Oscar's.

- **Oscar**: I used to beat Nina in every art school competition. This should be a celebration for me!
- **Lucy**: Who remembers those competitions? It's been twenty years. Don't be immature, Oscar.

Oscar turns to another guest at the party.

- **Oscar**: When I went to school with Nina, I would paint all day and night. Nina hardly ever used to paint!
- **Man**: Wow, she's so talented that she didn't even need to paint daily to complete her assignments?
- **Oscar**: No! I would always finish a new painting every week, and she usually only finished one every month.
- **Man**: I guess what they say is true: great art really does take time!

Oscar walks away angrily while Lucy follows.

- **Lucy**: Oscar, no one cares who was better twenty years ago.
- **Oscar**: But I always won first place in competitions. She was always second place!

Nina arrives, and the crowd claps. She stands in front of one of her paintings, which is covered by a curtain. The crowd becomes quiet.

- **Nina**: Thank you all for being here, especially my old classmate Oscar. He was always so competitive, and that helped me become a better artist.
  - In fact, one of these paintings **features** Oscar!

Nina pulls back the curtain, **revealing** an enormous **portrait** of Oscar. Everyone claps.

- **Oscar**: Maybe you're right, Lucy. The past isn't important. Besides, everyone remembers the subject of a portrait more than the artist who painted it!

They move closer to look at the painting.

- **Oscar**: Can you see the painting's title?
- **Lucy**: Yes… It's called Second Place.

## Writing

### Do you think Oscar likes Nina's painting in the end? Why or why not?

I think Oscar won't like Nina's painting. Oscar always thinks he is the best, but the painting says Nina is better than him. Oscar won't accept it.

> Corrections:

1. “I think Oscar won't like Nina's painting.” → grammatically correct, but smoother as: **“I don’t think Oscar will like Nina’s painting.”**
2. “Oscar always thinks he is the best, but the painting says Nina is better than him.”
   → “…better than him” is grammatically acceptable in casual English, but more formal would be: **“better than he is.”**

I don’t think Oscar will like Nina’s painting. Oscar always thinks he is the best, but the painting says Nina is better than he is. Oscar won’t accept that.

我觉得奥斯卡不会喜欢妮娜的画。奥斯卡一直认为自己是最棒的，而那幅画却表现出妮娜比他更优秀。他不会接受这一点。

- Informal English (Correct and Common):
  - **"Nina is better than him."**
    - This is **very natural** in speech and casual writing. Most native speakers say it this way.
- Formal/Traditional Grammar:
  - **"Nina is better than he is."**
    - This is considered more **grammatically complete**, especially in formal or academic writing.
    - The idea is: "than" is a **conjunction** (like "because" or "although"). So the sentence continues logically as: "Nina is better than he **is** [better]."
    - The **"is"** at the end is usually dropped in informal speech, but traditional grammar says it's implied.

I think Oscar will not like Nina's painting in the end, because it's title is the Second Place. Oscar really ~~want every one thinks~~ he is the best.

I think Oscar will not like Nina's painting in the end because **its** title is ~~the~~ Second Place. Oscar really **wants** **everyone to think** he is the best.

> - “Oscar really **wants everyone to think he is the best**” → grammatically fine, but can be slightly improved for emphasis and natural flow.

I think Oscar will not like Nina's painting in the end because **its** title is "**Second Place."** Oscar really **wants everyone to see** him as the best.
