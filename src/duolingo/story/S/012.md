# Spilled Sugar - B2

Vikram and his friend Lin are at the local TV studio. They are one of the teams on a baking competition show.

- **Lin**: Oh… We're competing against Sue. She was the **villain** on the last season of this show.
- **Vikram**: Really? I've never actually watched this show.
- **Lin**: You haven't? She manipulates people to get what she wants.

Suddenly, Sue runs over to them.

- **Sue**: Help! I spilled my sugar.
  - Could I have some of yours?
- **Vikram**: Of course!
- **Lin**: Vikram, she's our **competition**. You don't have to help her.
- **Vikram**: I want to win because our cake is the best, not because Sue didn't have any sugar.
- **Lin**: Fine.
- **Vikram**: Take whatever you need, Sue.
- **Sue**: Thanks.

Sue takes most of Vikram's sugar. Next, Vikram starts to add sugar to his bowl, but he doesn't have enough.

- **Vikram**: Oops, I wish I had **measured** our sugar first…
- **Lin**: Sue took our sugar because she wanted to ruin our cake. She just pretended to need help to take advantage of you.
- **Vikram**: What? I'm not sure about that.
- **Lin**: It's true. I pretend not to know how to set up my Wi-Fi so that someone else will do it for me.
- **Vikram**: Hey! I've done that for you!
- **Lin**: Exactly.
- **Vikram**: Well, maybe our cake will be OK with only a little sugar…

They bake their cake. The Judge tries it.

- **Judge**: Wow! I can really taste the flavors in this cake. It's not as sweet as all the other cakes.
- **Vikram**: Lin, we might win!
- **Judge**:… and I absolutely hate it!
  - Sue's cake, on the other hand, is delicious. She's our new winner.
- **Vikram**: I'm so sorry, Lin. It's my fault we lost. I shouldn't have given Sue our sugar.
- **Lin**: It's OK. Let's just **clean up** and go home now.
  - But can you wash the pans? I don't know how to load this dishwasher.
- **Vikram**: OK.
  - Wait! You're just pretending to be helpless so I'll do it for you!
- **Lin**: Oops, I wish I hadn't told you that.

## Sentences

- 哇！我真的能尝出这块蛋糕的各种风味。它没有其他蛋糕那么甜。
  - Wow! I can really taste the flavors in this cake. It's not as sweet as all the other cakes.

## Writing

### What do you think about Sue's strategy? Why?

I think Sue's strategy is **disgusting**, but it is useful. In real life, I also met similar people use such strategy and it helps them a lot. But I don't like this kind of people and I'll try my best to make this kind of person out of my life.

> 1. **"use such strategy"** → 应为 **"use such a strategy"** 或更自然的 **"people who use similar strategies"**
> 2. **"it helps them a lot"** → 更自然表达为 **"it often helps them get what they want"**
> 3. **"this kind of people"** → 搭配错误，应为 **"this kind of person"** 或 **"these kinds of people"**
> 4. **"make this kind of person out of my life"** → 语法错误，应改为 **"keep such people out of my life"**（常见表达）

I think Sue's strategy is **disgusting**, but it is **effective**. In real life, I **have also met** people who use similar **strategies**, and it often helps them **get** what they want. However, I do not like this kind of person, and I will try my best to keep such people out of my life.

我认为 Sue 的策略令人反感，但确实有效。在现实生活中，我也遇到过使用类似策略的人，这种方法确实帮助他们达到了目的。不过我不喜欢这样的人，我会尽力让这种人远离我的生活。

**更自然、语法正确、适合写作的改写版本**：

I think Sue's strategy was dishonest, but unfortunately, it worked. She pretended to need help just to take Vikram's sugar and ruin their chances of winning. In real life, I have also met people who use similar **tactics** to manipulate others for personal gain. Even though such strategies may succeed sometimes, I do not respect them, and I try to avoid people who behave this way.

我认为 Sue 的策略不诚实，但很遗憾，它确实奏效了。她假装需要帮助，只是为了拿走 Vikram 的糖，破坏他们获胜的机会。在现实生活中，我也遇到过用类似手段操控他人的人。虽然这种策略有时会成功，但我不认可这种做法，也会尽量远离这样的人。
