# Something New

Lin and Bea are standing together in the park.

They're both holding skateboards and wearing **helmets**. Kids are **skating** around them.

- **Lin**: Why are we doing this again?
- **Bea**: Because I've always wanted to try **skateboarding**.
  - I try to do one new thing every day!
- **Lin**: OK, that's why you are trying skateboarding.
  - But why am I doing it?
- **Bea**: Because you're my friend and you support me!
  - Don't worry, it'll be fun!
- **Lin**: But don't you think we're too old for skateboarding?
- **Bea**: Excuse me. We are not old!
- **Lin**: We're at least ten years older than everyone here.
- **Bea**: Oh, Lin, watch out!

An 8-year-old girl **skates** past Lin.

- **Girl**: Excuse me, ma'am!
- **Lin**: Did that little girl just call me "ma'am"?

Bea laughs at Lin.

- **Bea**: Just **get on** your skateboard and try it.
  - If you fall, I promise I'll catch you!
- **Lin**: Fine. I'll try it.

Lin gets on the skateboard and immediately falls off.

- **Lin**: You promised to catch me!
- **Bea**: I'm sorry. I didn't expect you to fall right away.

Bea helps Lin stand up.

- **Bea**: Come on. Let's go catch that girl who called you "ma'am".

Later that day, Lin and Bea are at the hospital.

Bea's arm is broken.

- **Bea**: Maybe skateboarding was a bad idea. I just really like to do one new thing every day.
- **Lin**: Well, have you ever broken your arm before?
- **Bea**: No…
- **Lin**: Then you did two new things today!

### Speaking

Would you like to do new things every day? What would you do first? Why?

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.5+

No, I wouldn’t enjoy doing too many new things in a short period of time. While trying new things can give people the illusion of making progress, **I believe** learning in **a structured and consistent way** is far more effective. It might not lead to immediate results, but over time, it can create **significant**, **long-lasting** improvement.

不，我不喜欢在短时间内做太多新鲜事。虽然尝试新事物可能会让人产生一种进步的错觉，但我认为以结构化、持续性的方式学习更加有效。虽然一开始可能看不到明显成果，但随着时间推移，这种方式会带来深远的进步。

#### Original

No, I would not love **to** do too **many** new things in a short period of time. Doing new things **gives** people the illusion that they are making progress. But in my opinion, learning things in **a structured way** is more important. It may not **lead to** big progress at the **beginning**, but as time **flies**, it will make a huge difference.

### Practice

I would love to do new things every year. Doing new things every day is too much pressure. **Trying** new things every year will be much better.

> There's a small **inconsistency in verb forms** across the sentences. The first sentence uses "to do", the second uses "doing", and the third uses "trying". For smooth style and parallel structure, you should **use consistent verb forms**.

I would love **to do** new things every year. **Doing** new things every day is too much pressure. **Doing** new things every year would be much better.

这类语法叫做 **parallel structure**（平行结构），意思是：**在句子中列举、比较或重复动作时，语法形式要保持一致**。下面是一些常见的错误和改正例子：

---

#### 常见平行结构错误与改正

1. **Infinitive vs Gerund 不统一**
   1. ❌ I like **to read**, **writing**, and **to travel**.
   2. I like **to read**, **to write**, and **to travel**.
   3. 或：I like **reading**, **writing**, and **traveling**.
2. **Noun vs Verb 不统一**

   1. ❌ She enjoys **cooking**, **to jog**, and **movies**.
   2. She enjoys **cooking**, **jogging**, and **watching movies**.
   3. 或：She enjoys **cooking**, **jogging**, and **going to the movies**.

3. **Verb tense 不一致**

   1. ❌ He **ran** into the room, **jumps** on the table, and **was shouting**.
   2. He **ran** into the room, **jumped** on the table, and **shouted**.
   3. **列表不一致（名词 vs 动词短语）**

4. ❌ My goals are: **success**, **to be rich**, and **working hard**.
   1. My goals are: **to succeed**, **to be rich**, and **to work hard**.
   2. 或：**success**, **wealth**, and **hard work**.

Yes, I would love **to** do new things every year. Doing new things **every day** is too much pressure for me. If I have time, I would get a CFA certificate first, it will help me understand finance.

> Corrections:

1. 第一句用的是 **"Yes, I would love to do"**，后面第二句却用 **"Doing…"**，语法上不一致（平行结构不统一）。
2. 第三句中 “**If I have time, I would get…**” 混用了 **现在时 + 虚拟语气**，应该统一为虚拟语气。
3. “**it will help me**” 同样应该使用虚拟语气与前句保持一致。

Yes, I would love **to** do new things every year. Doing new things **every day** is too much pressure for me. If I **had** time, I **would** get a CFA certificate first — it **would** help me understand finance.

是的，我很想每年都尝试新事物。每天做新事物对我来说压力太大了。如果我有时间，我会先考个 CFA 证书，那将有助于我理解金融。

虚拟语气用于表达**假设、不真实、愿望或与现实相反的情况**，常出现在：

- **If 条件句**
- **wish / would rather / it's time 等句式**
- **建议 / 要求 / 命令类句型**

#### 常见结构：**If 虚拟语气三大类**

| 类型                       | 用法                  | 结构                                                  | 示例                                           | 中文 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| 现在假设（与现在事实相反） | If + 过去式           | If I **had** time, I **would** study.                 | 如果我有时间，我就会学习。（现实是我没时间）   |      |
| 过去假设（与过去事实相反） | If + had + 过去分词   | If I **had studied**, I **would have passed**.        | 如果我那时学习了，我就通过了。（现实是没通过） |      |
| 将来假设（不太可能）       | If + should / were to | If I **were to win** the lottery, I **would travel**. | 如果我中彩票，我会去旅游。                     |      |

#### 其他虚拟语气表达

| 表达                                  | 示例                            | 中文                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| I wish + 过去式（现在愿望）           | I wish I **knew** the answer.   | 我希望我知道答案。（其实不知道） |
| I wish + had + 过去分词（过去后悔）   | I wish I **hadn't said** that.  | 我希望我没说那话。（但说了）     |
| It's time + 过去式                    | It's time you **went** to bed.  | 你该去睡觉了。                   |
| would rather + 过去式                 | I'd rather you **stayed** home. | 我宁愿你呆在家里。               |
| 建议/要求：**that + 主语 + 动词原形** | I suggest that he **go** early. | 我建议他早点去。                 |

#### 易错提醒：

- ❌ If I **was** rich, I would travel.
- ✅ If I **were** rich, I would travel.（"were" 是正式的虚拟语气用法，适用于所有人称）

---

Yes, I would love **to** do new things, but not **every day**. Doing it **every day** is too much pressure for me. If I did new things, I'd like to learn some new technical knowledge. It makes me feel confident and it also **takes time**.

> - **“Doing it every day is too much pressure for me.”**
>   ✔️ 虽然语法没错，但为了与上一句保持句式一致，建议统一为“doing new things”。
> - **“It makes me feel confident and it also takes time.”**
>   ✔️ 上下文是**假设语气**（If I did…），因此这句也应使用虚拟语气的结构：“it would make me feel… and would take time。”

Yes, I would love to do new things, but not every day. Doing **new things** every day is too much pressure for me. If I **did** new things, **I'd like** to learn some new technical knowledge. It **would** make me feel confident, and it **would** also take time.

是的，我很想尝试新事物，但不是每天都做。每天做新事物对我来说压力太大了。如果我做新事物，我希望是学习一些新的技术知识。这会让我更有自信，但也确实需要时间。
