# Stolen Art - B2

Oscar is attending an **exclusive** art show **featuring** Jerome Gale, his former student.

Oscar gasps as he looks at a painting and turns to a stranger standing next to him.

- **Oscar**: Can you believe this?! Jerome Gale stole my style!
- **Stranger**: That's interesting. Why do you think that?
- **Oscar**: Jerome was my student! And his paintings of mountains look just like my paintings of mountains.
- **Stranger**: That's ridiculous. Lots of painters paint mountains, almost all of them, in fact.
- **Oscar**: If you saw my work, you'd agree that Jerome stole my style.
  - Look at the color he used!
- **Stranger**: Brown?
- **Oscar**: I use that shade of brown! I'll prove it to you!

Oscar finds Jerome, grabs his hand, and leads him over to the woman.

- **Jerome**: Oscar! Thanks so much for coming!
- **Oscar**: Yeah, sure. Now tell this woman how much I influenced you.
- **Jerome**: Oh! I actually **owe** all of my success to you, Oscar.

Oscar turns **triumphantly** to the woman.

- **Oscar**: See?! I told you!
- **Jerome**: Yes, Oscar's art inspired my best work! Like that brown mountain painting over there. I hope you don't mind, Oscar.
- **Oscar**: Of course I don't mind! I'm proud to see my student become a famous artist.
  - That means I'm a great teacher.
- **Jerome**: You are! This is basically a show for both me and you, Oscar.

Oscar looks proud as his eyes fill with tears.

- **Stranger**: Well, I'll be sure to include that in my review of the show.
- **Oscar**: Review?
- **Stranger**: Yes, I'm an **art critic** for The Intellectual Journal.
- **Jerome**: Wow! So what do you think of my art?
- **Oscar**: Yes, what do you think? It's great, right?
- **Stranger**: Honestly, I think it's shockingly terrible and unoriginal.
- **Jerome**: Oh…
- **Stranger**: Now, what's your last name, Oscar? I want to make sure you get credit for influencing Jerome's work.
- **Oscar**: No, I don't think I really influenced his work!
  - All artists paint mountains!

## Writing

### What do you think Sylvia, the art critic, wrote in her review?

I believe that Sylvia **will** probably mention some artists **who** use similar color **shades** to paint mountains, but these artists were doing better jobs and their **artworks** are earlier.

> Corrections:

1. “**will probably** mention” 和 “**were doing**” 时态混乱。
   - 应统一为将来时或假设语气。
2. “**some artists who use similar color shades**”
   - → 建议加定语清晰表达：**“who used similar shades of color to paint mountains”**。
3. “**doing better jobs**”
   - → 不自然，建议改为：**“did a better job”** 或 **“produced stronger work”**。
4. “**their artworks are earlier**”
   - → 应为过去时：“**their artworks came earlier**” 或 “**were created earlier**”。

I believe Sylvia will probably mention some artists who used similar shades of color to paint mountains, but who did a better job and whose artworks were created earlier.

我认为西尔维娅很可能会提到一些也使用相似色调画山的艺术家，但这些艺术家的作品完成得更好，而且创作时间更早。

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0–7.5

I think Sylvia, the art critic, wrote a very negative review. Although Oscar was proud that Jerome admitted being influenced by him, Sylvia didn’t like Jerome’s work at all. She said it was shockingly terrible and unoriginal. It’s likely that she criticized the painting style, the lack of originality, and maybe even mentioned Oscar as the source of those bad ideas.

我认为艺术评论人西尔维娅写了一篇非常负面的评论。虽然奥斯卡因为杰罗姆承认受到他影响而感到自豪，但西尔维娅根本不喜欢杰罗姆的作品。她说这些画“糟糕得令人震惊，毫无原创性”。她很可能批评了他的绘画风格、缺乏创意，甚至可能提到奥斯卡是那些糟糕点子的来源。

- originality: 英 /ə,rɪdʒɪ'nælɪtɪ/ 美 /ə'rɪdʒə'næləti/
  - n. 独创性;创造性
