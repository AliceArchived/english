# Switching Partners - B3

Zari and Lily are in the school hallway. Zari looks upset.

- **Zari**: I can't believe this! Mr. Thomas didn't choose me as his partner for the advanced science project!
- **Lily**: Uh… so? It's just a project.
- **Zari**: Just a project?! This is the project! And I'm **stuck with** Brian. He always messes up everything!
- **Lily**: Maybe he'll be fine this time.
- **Zari**: No, he won't! I'll fail. My grade will fall. My life will be over!
- **Lily**: OK, **dramatic** much?

Zari looks at Lily, **wide-eyed with hope**.

- **Zari**: Lily, you're Brian's partner, right?
- **Lily**: Yeah… why?
- **Zari**: Can we switch partners? Please?
- **Lily**: Switch partners? You shouldn't —

Zari's eyes start to water.

- **Zari**: Please! I can't work with Brian. I NEED this!
- **Lily**: Ugh. Fine. I'll switch with you.

Later, Lily and Zari sit in the library with their new partners. Lily **flips** through the science book.

- **Lily**: Zari… do you even know what our project is?
- **Zari**: We have to create a model of the solar system.
- **Lily**: OK, that's… not bad.
- **Zari**: But it has to **spin** and **light** up.
- **Lily**: What?! We can't do that!

Zari sighs, looking guilty.

- **Zari**: I'm sorry, Lily…
- **Lily**: I switched to help you. Now we're BOTH going to fail.
- **Zari**: No, we just… need to work really hard.
- **Lily**: Great. I wanted less work, not more. This is officially the worst project ever.
- **Zari**: But it's our project. So teamwork?
- **Lily**: Sure. But if this messes up, you're blaming Brian.

换搭档

Zari 和 Lily 在学校走廊上。Zari 看起来很沮丧。

- **Zari**：我简直不敢相信！Thomas 先生没有选我做他的高级科学项目的搭档！
- **Lily**：呃……所以呢？这只是一个项目。
- **Zari**：只是一个项目？！这是 _那个_ 项目！而且我还得跟 Brian 一组。他总是把一切搞砸！
- **Lily**：也许这次他会好的。
- **Zari**：不，他不会！我会不及格，我的成绩会下降，我的生活会完蛋！
- **Lily**：好吧，你真够戏剧化的。

Zari 带着满眼的希望看着 Lily。

- **Zari**：Lily，你是 Brian 的搭档，对吧？
- **Lily**：是啊……怎么了？
- **Zari**：我们能换搭档吗？求你了？
- **Lily**：换搭档？你不应该——

Zari 眼里开始泛起泪光。

- **Zari**：求你了！我不能跟 Brian 一起工作。我真的需要这个！
- **Lily**：呃，好吧。我跟你换。

后来，Lily 和 Zari 与她们的新搭档坐在图书馆里。Lily 翻着科学书。

- **Lily**：Zari……你到底知道我们的项目是什么吗？
- **Zari**：我们要做一个太阳系模型。
- **Lily**：好吧，这……不算糟。
- **Zari**：但它必须能旋转，还要会发光。
- **Lily**：什么？！我们做不到的！

Zari 叹了口气，看起来很愧疚。

- **Zari**：对不起，Lily……
- **Lily**：我换是为了帮你。现在我们俩都会不及格。
- **Zari**：不，我们只需要……非常努力工作。
- **Lily**：太好了，我是想少点工作，不是更多。这正式成为史上最糟的项目了。
- **Zari**：但这是我们的项目。团队合作？
- **Lily**：当然。不过如果搞砸了，你得怪 Brian。

## Speaking & Writing

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Why does Lily switch partners with Zari?**

Well, Lily decides to switch partners because Zari **keeps asking her**, and in the end, she **gives in**. At first, she probably thinks it’s just a simple favor between classmates. **But once** they start working **on** the project, it turns out to be far more challenging than they expected. Zari begins to worry that they won’t be able to finish it on time, so she ends up asking Lily to work closely with her and contribute more actively to make sure they succeed.

嗯，Lily 之所以决定换搭档，是因为 Zari 一直请求她，最终她答应了。起初，她可能认为这只是同学之间的一个小忙。但等她们开始做项目时，发现它比预想的要困难得多。Zari 开始担心她们无法按时完成，因此她最后请求 Lily 和她更紧密地合作，并更积极地投入，以确保她们顺利完成。

> Explanation:

This version uses conversational connectors (“Well,” “At first,” “But once”) and natural storytelling to reflect spoken fluency. It includes a logical sequence of events, varied vocabulary (“gives in,” “far more challenging,” “work closely”), and complex sentence structures, which are characteristics of Band 7+ speaking.

- give in: 屈服, 让步，呈交

### 🌟 Writing Band 7.0+

**Why does Lily switch partners with Zari?**

Lily switches partners because Zari **persistently** asks for **the change**, and Lily eventually agrees. **Initially**, she **perceives** the arrangement as a minor adjustment that would not greatly affect her workload. However, as the project progresses, it becomes clear that the task is significantly more challenging than either of them had anticipated. Zari **grows increasingly concerned** that they will be unable to complete it within the required timeframe. Consequently, she requests that Lily not only remain her partner but also collaborate more actively, ensuring that both contribute equally to overcoming the project’s difficulties and achieving a successful outcome.

Lily 换搭档是因为 Zari 坚持要求更换，Lily 最终同意了。起初，她认为这一安排只是一个不会大幅影响她工作量的小调整。然而，随着项目的推进，她们发现任务比预想的要困难得多。Zari 越来越担心她们无法在规定时间内完成。因此，她请求 Lily 不仅继续做她的搭档，还要更加积极地合作，确保双方均衡投入，从而克服项目的难题并取得成功。

> Explanation:

The IELTS Writing version is strong for several reasons:

1. Clear task focus – It directly answers the question (“Why does Lily switch partners with Zari?”) and fully explains the circumstances, showing good task achievement.
2. Logical progression – Events are presented in a coherent order: Zari’s request → Lily’s agreement → realization of project difficulty → Zari’s concern → request for closer cooperation. This sequencing meets the Band 7+ “coherence and cohesion” criterion.
3. Varied vocabulary – Uses higher-level synonyms such as **persistently asks**, **minor adjustment**, anticipated, timeframe, collaborate, contribute equally, overcoming difficulties, which demonstrate lexical resource.
4. Complex sentence structures – Includes multiple subordinate clauses, relative clauses, and participle phrases (e.g., “Initially, she perceives the arrangement as…”, “Consequently, she requests that Lily not only… but also…”). This variety reflects Band 7+ grammar range and accuracy.
5. Formal academic tone – Avoids casual connectors like “But” and uses formal transitions (“However,” “Consequently”) that are appropriate for IELTS Writing Task 2 style.
