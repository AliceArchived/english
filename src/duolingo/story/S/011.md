# Space Viking

Lily and Zari are in art class.

- **Zari**: I'm so excited to see "Space Viking 2" tonight!

Their teacher, Oscar, hears them talking about the movie.

- **Oscar**: "Space Viking?!"
  - Please don't tell me you are going to see that movie!
- **Lily**: Yes. Tonight.
- **Oscar**: Tonight?! You're artists. You shouldn't watch action movies.
- **Zari**: We enjoy action movies.
- **Lily**: They're stupid, but they're fun.
- **Oscar**: When you watch those kinds of movies, you don't learn anything.
  - You should watch **artistic and intelligent movies**.
- **Zari**: That sounds boring.
- **Oscar**: I have two tickets to the international film festival tonight. Please, take them!
- **Lily**: OK, we'll think about it.

Later, Zari and Lily are outside the movie theatre.

- **Zari**: Wow, look at all the people here to see "Space Viking 2"!
- **Lily**: Is that… our teacher?

Oscar is outside the movie theater, wearing a "Space Viking" costume.

The girls walk over to him.

- **Zari**: Sir! Are you here to see "Space Viking 2"?
- **Oscar**: Uh… No?
- **Lily**: Then why are you wearing that costume?
- **Zari**: You're a "Space Viking fan"!
- **Oscar**: Maybe I am.
- **Lily**: You said we wouldn't learn anything.
- **Zari**: But we learned that our art teacher likes action movies!
- **Oscar**: I just wanted to watch my movie alone.
- **Lily**: OK. See you on Monday, "Space Viking"…

## Writing

### Oscar wants to see "Space Viking 2" even if it's not an artistic film. Which movie do you want to see? Why?

I want to see movies talking about human, which make me thinking, such as the gold father.

> - "movies talking about human" → 不自然，应改为 “movies about human nature” 或 “movies that explore **humanity**”
> - “which make me thinking” → “make me **think**” 是正确结构（动词原形）
> - “the gold father” → 拼写错误，应为 “The Godfather”（电影名应大写）

I want to see movies that **explore human nature** and make me think, such as _The Godfather_.

我想看一些探讨人性、能引发我思考的电影，比如《教父》。

I want to see romantic movies. Artistic films are too serious, and I just want to relax. Action movies are difficult for me too. I always can't understand what the movie was talking about even at the end of them. In my opinion, they are just some people fighting.

> 1. **“I always can't understand…”** → 语序错误，应改为 **“I can never understand…”**（"always can't" 不自然）
> 2. **“what the movie was talking about”** → 更自然表达为 **“what the movie is about”**（泛指内容，用一般现在时）
> 3. **“even at the end of them”** → 语法不自然，改为 **“even by the end”** 更流畅
> 4. **“they are just some people fighting”** → “some” 多余，**“just people fighting”** 更地道

I want to see romantic movies. Artistic films are too serious, and I just want to relax. Action movies are difficult for me too. I **can never understand** what the movie **is** about, **even by the end**. In my opinion, they are just **people** fighting.

我想看爱情电影。艺术片太严肃了，而我只是想放松一下。动作片对我来说也太难了。我总是到最后也搞不懂电影讲了什么。在我看来，它们就是一些人在打架而已。
