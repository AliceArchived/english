# Save the Animals

Oscar is walking into the school where he works. He's wearing a long fur coat. Another teacher stops him.

- **Paul**: Oscar, wait! Are you wearing a fur coat?
- **Oscar**: Yes, isn't it gorgeous? It belonged to my uncle. Fur coats were very fashionable when he was young.
- **Paul**: Uh… yes, but I don't know if it's still OK to wear a fur coat. Especially not today, because —
- **Oscar**: Oh, Paul! You don't know anything about fashion.

Oscar and Paul get to the school building and see kids in front of a sign that says: "Save the animals!"

- **Oscar**: What's this?
- **Paul**: This is what I was trying to tell you… The kids are protesting to save the animals from the fur industry.

Lily **walks over** holding a bucket of red paint.

- **Lily**: The fur industry is cruel! Take off that coat, or I'm going to throw this paint on you.
- **Oscar**: This coat is **vintage**! It was my uncle's! I didn't hurt any animals!
- **Lily**: Yes, but your uncle did. Take it off.
- **Oscar**: It's cold right now! And this is the warmest coat I have!
- **Lily**: You want to hurt animals so you can be warm and stylish?

Oscar **turns** to Paul.

- **Oscar**: See, Paul? I told you this coat was stylish.
- **Lily**: I know you're my art teacher, but I have to do this.

Lily holds up the bucket of paint.

- **Oscar**: Wait!
  - My coat isn't real fur.
- **Lily**: It isn't?
- **Paul**: Why didn't you just say that?
- **Oscar**: I wanted everyone to think I was wearing an expensive fur coat.
- **Lily**: Oh. **In** that case, you can have this paint back. I stole it from your classroom.

I loved this story. Oscar was funny in this story —He didn't wear a real fur coat, but he wanted everyone to admire him. Oscar lied it was a real fur coat until Lily was going to throw paint on it.

> 1. **“—He”** → 连字符后不需大写，应为 **“— he”**
> 2. **“lied it was”** → 应改为 **“lied and said it was”**；更自然也更符合英文表达习惯
> 3. **“going to throw paint”** → 正确，但 **“was about to throw paint”** 更自然地表达“马上要做某事”

I loved this story. It's a bit funny for Oscar, since he didn't wear a real fur coat, but he just faked it's real fur coat.

> - “faked it’s real fur coat” should be “faked that it was a real fur coat” or “pretended it was a real fur coat.”
> - “It’s a bit funny for Oscar” would sound more natural as “It’s a bit funny **because** Oscar…”

I loved this story. It's a bit funny **because** Oscar didn't wear a real fur coat **—** he just pretended it was real.
_or_
I loved this story. It's a bit funny because Oscar didn't wear a real fur coat, he just faked that it **was** one.

I love this story. In this story, Oscar is so funny. He wants everyone to admire his fur coat at first. He lied about his coat ~~to be~~ real fur and it is stylish and expensive. But that is not real fur. he lied until Lily attempted to throw paint on it.

I love this story. In this story, Oscar is so funny. He wants everyone to admire his fur coat at first. He lied about his coat being real fur and it is stylish and expensive. But that is not real fur. He continued lying until Lily attempted to throw paint on it.

> - “I love this story” 用现在时不太自然，应为过去时 “**I loved this story**”，因为故事已读完。
> - “at first” 的位置更自然放在句首或句末。
> - “He lied about his coat being real fur and it is stylish and expensive” 时态不一致，应统一为过去时。
> - “that is not real fur” 应为过去时 “that was not real fur”。
> - “until Lily attempted to throw paint on it” 的句子结构不完整，建议补充主句以清楚表达结果。

I **loved** this story. In the story, Oscar **is** so funny. At first, he **wants** everyone to admire his fur coat. He **lied** about it being real fur, **saying** it **was** stylish and expensive. But it **was** not real fur. He **kept** lying until Lily **tried** to throw paint on it.

我很喜欢这个故事。故事里的奥斯卡非常有趣。一开始，他想让所有人都赞美他的皮草大衣。他谎称那是真皮草，还说它很时尚、很贵。但那其实是假的。他一直撒谎，直到莉莉试图往大衣上泼颜料。

即使故事发生在过去，描述角色的“特点”时可以用现在时。

In the story, Oscar **is** so funny.

这是在用“现在时”表达你**现在的观点或感受**，而不是复述具体发生的事件。你在评论人物的性格或特点，这是现在时常见的用法。

- In _Harry Potter_, Hermione **is** very smart.
- In the movie, the villain **is** terrifying.
- In the story, the ending **is** surprising.

👉 这些都是**在现在时中评论作品内容**，虽然故事已经“过去”，但你的感受是“现在”的。

### Formal / Academic Version:

Yes, I **enjoyed** this story very much. I **found** Oscar’s behavior both **humorous** and **ironic**. He wore a fake fur coat but pretended it was real because he wanted others to admire him. However, when one of the students threatened to throw red paint on him to **protest** the fur industry, he immediately **confessed** the truth. This **twist** at the end made the story both entertaining and meaningful, as it touched on issues like **vanity**, **peer pressure**, and **animal rights** in a light-hearted way.

是的，我非常喜欢这个故事。我觉得 Oscar 的行为既有趣又带点讽刺。他穿着一件假皮草外套，却假装是真的，只是为了让别人羡慕他。但当一位学生威胁要向他泼红漆以抗议皮草产业时，他立刻坦白了真相。这个结局令人惊喜又有深意，因为它以轻松的方式涉及了虚荣、同辈压力和动物权益等议题。
