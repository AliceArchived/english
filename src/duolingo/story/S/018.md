# Surviving a Music Festival - B2

An **excerpt** from "Oscar's Guide to a Life Worth Living"

One day, you may make the terrible decision to attend an electronic music festival. In my case, I was invited by my friend Lucy for a birthday celebration. I thought I'd be able to tolerate the chaos, but I was wrong.

If you make the same mistake, you'll need these tips to survive.

**Don't dress like the other attendees.**

You'll notice people wearing **furry boots** and **neon bracelets**. You might want to join them, but remember that everyone will have a camera.

You'll never be able to forget the shame of dressing like a **radioactive** bear in public.

**Always pay extra for a VIP ticket.**

These tickets allow access to special areas away from the sun and **sweaty** young people.

Although I didn't buy the VIP ticket, I regretted it every time I saw people my age in the VIP section, looking comfortable and relaxed.

**Bring earplugs.**

They'll reduce the sound of the "music" so much that it'll feel like you're not even at a music festival. It also helps to walk as far away from the speakers as possible — **preferably** all the way to the parking lot.

If you follow these rules, you might survive a music festival. And whatever you do, never get caught dancing. If you seem like you're having fun, you'll get invited to another festival and soon find yourself standing in another **muddy field**.

## Speaking

Would you follow Oscar's advice? Why or why not?

### 🌟 IELTS Speaking Band 7.0+

Yes, I would follow Oscar’s advice. Personally, I don’t like wearing **embarrassing** or **flashy** outfits, and I’m not very good at dancing either. I prefer to avoid situations where I might feel awkward, so his advice makes sense to me.

是的，我会听从 Oscar 的建议。就我个人而言，我不喜欢穿尴尬或太招摇的衣服，而且我跳舞也跳得不好。我更喜欢避免让自己尴尬的场合，所以我觉得他的建议对我来说是有道理的。
