# Space Turtles

Eddy is in the kitchen paying his bills. He sees an unusual charge on his credit card bill.

- **Eddy**: Junior? Do you play a game called Space Turtles?
- **Junior**: Yes, it's about turtles fighting robots … in space! You download it for me on my phone, remember?
- **Eddy**: Oh, yeah. I remember now.
- **Junior**: It's a great game!
  - Look at all of the turtles I downloaded!
- **Eddy**: Junior, I think the game charge**s** my credit card every time you download new turtles. You spent $150!
- **Junior**: Oops, sorry. I didn't know. I'm just a kid!
- **Eddy**: Ugh … I'll call their customer service number. Maybe they'll give me a refund.

**Eddy calls customer service. A woman named Pamela answers.**

- **Pamela**: How can I help you?
- **Eddy**: Hi! My son spent $150 on your game. Can I please get a refund?
- **Pamela**: Sorry, but we don't give refunds.
- **Eddy**: But he's only a kid. He didn't know you have to pay to download turtles. Please?
- **Pamela**: Fine. I'll ask my boss, but I don't think he will agree. I'll call you back.

**Pamela ends the call.**

**Eddy opens the game on Junior's phone.**

- **Eddy**: Come on, Junior. They probably won't give me my money back, so you can at least show me the game.

**Eddy and Junior play the game for an hour.**

**Finally, Pamela calls back.**

- **Pamela**: Good news. We can give you a refund.
- **Eddy**: Hooray!
- **Pamela**: We'll just delete all of the space turtles from your game.
- **Eddy**: What? No!
  - I love all of our space turtles! And actually, now I need to buy ten more, but it says my account is locked … Can you please help?
