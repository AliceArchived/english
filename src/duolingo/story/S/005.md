# Secret Place

Zari and Lily are hanging out on the roof of their apartment building.

- **Zari**: It's so cool up here. Why don't we ever come to the roof?

They notice a large cardboard box making noise.

- **Lily**: What is that?

Zari looks inside the box and sees Junior playing a video game.

- **Zari**: Junior, what are you doing in this box?
- **Junior**: Hi. This is my secret place. I come here to be **by myself**.
- **Zari**: Cool!
- **Junior**: Thanks, but please don't tell anyone about it.
- **Lily**: We won't.

The next day, Junior goes back to his secret place on the roof, but Lily and Zari are already there.

- **Lily**: Hi Junior! Look, we brought some lights and decorations.
- **Zari**: This place is even cooler now.
- **Junior**: But it's not secret anymore.
- **Bea**: Hello? I heard footsteps up here.

Their neighbor Bea joins them.

- **Lily**: Whoa, what is this?
- **Junior**: This used to be my favorite place.
- **Bea**: Wow, there's a great view up here.
  - I have an extra couch.
  - Should I bring it up?
- **Zari**: Definitely. Is that OK, Junior?
- **Junior**: Fine, but no one else can know about this place.

The next day when Junior goes to the roof, he hears music and voices.

Lily, Zari, and Bea are hanging out on the roof with a bunch of their neighbors, including Lucy and Eddy.

- **Junior**: Dad?
- **Eddy**: Junior! I'm so glad you're here! This is where everyone hangs out now!
- **Lucy**: Hi Junior! We're going to have a dance party! Come join us!
- **Junior**: That's OK, I'm going to go now.
- **Eddy**: Where?
- **Junior**: Ahhh… To find a new secret place.

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**What happened in this story? Tell us.**

The story is about Junior, who had a secret spot where he could spend time alone. At first, only Lily and Zari found it, and Junior asked them to **keep it a secret**. But **eventually**, Bea discovered it too. As more people started **showing up**, the place no longer felt private — so Junior decided he had to look for a new **hideout**.

这个故事讲的是 Junior 有一个属于自己的秘密基地，他可以一个人安静地待着。起初只有 Lily 和 Zari 找到了那里，Junior 让她们保守秘密。但后来 Bea 也发现了。随着越来越多人出现在那个地方，Junior 不再觉得那是他独享的空间 — 所以他决定去寻找一个新的藏身之处。

- But **eventually**, Bea discovered it too.
  - 在这个语境中，"eventually" 是合理的。
  - 它并不是表示“Bea 是最后一个发现这个地方的人”，而是表达：
    - “最终，连 Bea 也发现了这个地方。”
    - 即：Bea 的发现代表了某种“**发展到关键节点**”的时刻，不是“时间上的最后”。
  - 很多学习者以为 “eventually = 最后一个做某事的人/时刻”，但实际上：
    - eventually = after a process, at some point later, in the end（经过一段过程后，某事发生了）
    - 它表达的是事情的演变过程，不等同于 finally（强调“最后”）或 lastly（顺序最后）。

**Why does Junior leave the roof at the end?**

Junior leaves the roof because it’s no longer his secret spot. **What** used to be a peaceful place for him to relax and be alone is now known by everyone in the neighborhood — they even **throw** parties there. So in the end, he decides to find a new quiet place where he can truly be himself.

Junior 离开了屋顶，因为那里已经不再是他的秘密基地了。原本是他用来放松、独处的宁静空间，现在变成了邻里皆知的地方 — 他们甚至还在那里开派对。最后，他决定去找一个新的安静角落，让自己真正地独处做自己。

### Practice History

**What happened in this story? Tell us.**

In the story, Junior had a secret place where he **could** spent time alone. Then, Lily and Zari found this place, and Junior asked them to ~~keep it as a secret~~. However, Bea found it too. As more and more people found this place, Junior couldn't use it as his own secret place; he **needed** to find a new place.

> Corrections:

1. “could spent” → 应为 “could spend”（modal verb 后接原形动词）
2. “keep it as a secret” → 正确表达是 “**keep it a secret**”（固定搭配）
3. “his own secret place” → 改为 “his private spot” 更自然、口语化（可选）

In the story, Junior had a secret place where he could spend time alone. Then Lily and Zari discovered it, and Junior asked them to **keep it a secret**. However, Bea found it too. As more and more people found the place, Junior couldn’t use it as his **private spot** anymore — he needed to find a new one.

在这个故事中，Junior 有一个属于自己的秘密空间，他可以独处。但后来 Lily 和 Zari 发现了这个地方，Junior 请她们保密。然而，Bea 也找到了那里。随着越来越多人发现这个秘密地，Junior 就不能再把它当作属于自己的地方了 — 他需要另找一处新天地。

**Why does Junior leave the roof at the end?**

Junior leaves / no longer / secret spot

Junior leaves his secret place because this place is no longer secret anymore. It used to be his secret place **where** he **could** spend time ~~along~~, but now everyone in the neighborhood knows **about** it. **They** even hold **parties** at that place, Junior needs to find a new secret spot to **spend** time alone and be himself.

> Corrections:

1. “this place is no longer secret anymore” → “it’s no longer secret”（双重否定需避免）
2. “spend time along” → 应为 “spend time alone”（拼写错误）
3. “Junior needs to find a new secret spot to spend time alone and be himself” → 精简为 “a new place to be by himself” 更地道自然

Junior leaves his secret place because it’s no longer secret. It used to be a quiet spot where he could spend time **alone** — but now everyone in the neighborhood knows about it. They even hold parties there. So Junior needs to find a new place to be by himself.

Junior 离开了他原本的秘密基地，因为那里已经不再是秘密了。那曾经是他可以独处的地方 — 但现在邻居们都知道了，甚至还在那里举办派对。所以 Junior 需要找一个新的地方来独处、做自己。

#### No longer 和 anymore 是“敌人”，只能选一个用！

“no longer ... anymore” 就相当于说了两次否定，
有点像在说：“这个地方不再是秘密了，不再是秘密了” —— 语义上重复、啰嗦，甚至可能让句子逻辑变得模糊。

你可以任选其一：

1. It’s no longer secret.（书面表达）
2. It isn’t secret anymore.（更口语）

它们含义一样，但不能同时使用 no longer 和 anymore。
