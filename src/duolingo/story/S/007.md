# Smelling Salts, Bottle, Cup - B3

Lin, Joined 2009

Items Sold: 524

Hi there! I was cleaning up my apartment (well, my grandma Lucy's apartment), and I found some interesting things. They might sound surprising, but they could be useful to you. This is what I have today:

**Smelling Salts - Free**

I found these smelling salts in a drawer. They might belong to my grandmother or maybe a long-lost hero. Who knows? They're not expired, so they're good to go. If you feel faint or need a wake-up call, these are perfect for you. They're free!

**Glass Bottle - 3 dollars**

This glass bottle once held some mysterious drink. Now it's empty, clean, and waiting for its next role. Fill it with water, sand from the beach, or even some homemade sauce. It's like a blank canvas for glass!

**Empty Cup - 1 dollar**

I have an empty cup that didn't make it to the recycling bin. It's perfectly fine, really. Use it for your morning coffee or a cup of noodles. It's sturdy and ready to be filled with whatever your heart desires.

That's all I have for today!

Call, text, or email me!

## Speaking

### 🌟 Speaking Band 7.0+

**Which item seems most useful? Why?**

I think the glass bottle seems to be the most useful item — and the **higher price** also suggests it's **of some value**. If I had to choose something, I’d go with the bottle; otherwise, I wouldn’t take any of them.

我认为玻璃瓶看起来是最有用的物品 — 它较高的价格也说明它可能更有价值。如果我非选一样的话，我会选那个瓶子；否则，我一样都不会选。

### Practice History

**Which item seems most useful? Why?**

I think/ The most useful is/ I would choose

I think the most useful item is the glass bottle and its price also suggests it. I would choose the glass bottle if I must choose one; if not, I wouldn't choose anything.

> Corrections:

1. “and its price also suggests it” → 更自然表达为 “and its price suggests that as well”
2. “if I must choose one” → 更标准为虚拟语气 “if I had to pick one”

I think the most useful item is the glass bottle, and its price suggests that as well. I would choose the glass bottle if I **had** to pick one — otherwise, I wouldn't choose anything.

我觉得最有用的物品是那个玻璃瓶，从它的价格也可以看出这一点。如果我必须选一个，我会选它；如果不必选，我一个都不会要。
