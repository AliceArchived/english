# Year in Review - B2

From: vikram@duomail.co

To: bakeryclients@duomail.co

**Subject: New Year Newsletter**

Happy New Year, Customers!

In this month's newsletter, I'm reflecting on what an interesting year we've had at my bakery.

In January, I'd planned to upgrade our kitchen equipment because my employee, Lin, broke our oven.

Fortunately, Lin got a great deal on an oven to replace it.

Unfortunately, the oven was old and had a horrible fish smell, which attracted many stray cats.

I spent a week cleaning the oven until it was as good as new, and eventually we got all the cats to leave!

Then, **in honour of spring**, I decorated the front of the bakery with fake flowers.

Unfortunately, the flowers were so realistic they attracted a variety of birds - which attracted the cats again! At that point, we just accepted the cats as part of the bakery.

**Over the summer,** I'd intended to have a party to celebrate one year of business! However, due to the overwhelming number of cats on all of the tables and countertops, it ended up turning into a cat adoption event.

It wasn't my original plan, but it was surprisingly popular!

We found new homes for all of our furry bakery residents - and we sold a record number of pastries!

After such a fantastic year, I can't wait for what's next! Hopefully, not more cats.

## Sentences

- 夏天的时候，我本来打算举办一个派对来庆祝开业一周年！不过由于桌子和台面上猫太多，最后竟然变成了一场猫咪领养活动。
  - Over the summer, I'd intended to have a party to celebrate one year of business! However, due to the overwhelming number of cats on all of the tables and countertops, it ended up turning into a cat adoption event.
  - you **can** use **"during the summer"** instead of **"over the summer"** — both are correct and commonly used. But there's a **slight difference in tone and nuance**:
  - Over the summer
    - Slightly more casual and conversational
    - Often implies something developed or happened gradually during that period
    - Example: **Over the summer, I learned how to paint.**
  - During the summer
    - Slightly more formal or neutral
    - Emphasizes the timeframe in which something happened
    - Example: _During the summer, I worked at a library._
  - **Over the summer**, I'd intended to have a party...
    - Sounds natural and casual — it’s about your **intention** and how things **changed**.
    - 在整个夏天的这段时间里
  - **During the summer**, I'd intended to have a party...
    - Also correct, just a bit more neutral.
    - 在夏天期间（语气更正式）

## Writing

### How do you think Vikram feels about cats after this year? Why?

I think that he don't like too much cats at his bakery though the past year cats helped his business.

I think he **doesn't** like **cats** too much at his bakery **even** though cats helped his business **last year**.

I don’t think he likes **cats** **very** much at his bakery, **even** though cats helped his business **last year**.

I think that Vikram don't really like cats, but he still **tolerate** them.

> - “Vikram **don't** really like cats” → subject-verb agreement error. Should be **doesn't**.
> - “he still **tolerate** them” → again, subject-verb agreement. Should be **tolerates**.

I think that Vikram **doesn't** really like cats, but he still **tolerates** them.
