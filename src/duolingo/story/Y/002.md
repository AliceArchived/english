# Yoga Class

Lucy invited Eddy to a yoga class.

They're in the studio getting ready.

- **Lucy**: So, you've never been to a yoga class?
- **Eddy**: No, but I'm excited to try!
- **Lucy**: Maybe you should take the class for beginners instead…
- **Eddy**: No way! I'm not a beginner. I exercise all the time!
- **Lucy**: OK, but remember to go slow.
  - Yoga is difficult.
  - You need to control your breathing.
- **Eddy**: Well, I already know how to breathe (v.)…

The yoga instructor enters the studio.

- **Instructor**: Good morning, everyone!
  - Let's start by sitting down.
- **Eddy**: This is easy…
  - Also, that instructor is cute!
- **Lucy**: Eddy, remember to be careful.
- **Eddy**: Don't worry! I run every day. I'll be fine.
- **Instructor**: Now, lift your left leg.

Eddy starts to sweat.

- **Instructor**: Sir, are you OK?
- **Eddy**: Yes, yes. I'm fine.
- **Instructor**: Good. OK, now when you're ready, lift your right leg.
- **Eddy**: What? Lucy? How are you doing that?
- **Lucy**: Just remember to breathe…
- **Instructor**: Now, put your right leg in front of your left leg and lift your arms. Perfect…
- **Eddy**: Lucy, this hurts….
- **Lucy**: Breathe, Eddy!

Several minutes later, Eddy wakes up. Lucy and the instructor are looking down at him.

- **Lucy**: Eddy, are you OK?
- **Eddy**: Uh, yeah, but… what happened?
- **Lucy**: You fainted.
- **Instructor**: And you were sweating… a lot.
- **Eddy**: Sorry.
- **Instructor**: Sir, was this your first time doing yoga?
- **Eddy**: Uhh … yeah.
- **Instructor**: I think you should come back tomorrow. We have a class for beginners… like you.

### Practice History

**Why does Eddy faint during the yoga class?**

Eddy faints/ too difficult/ go slow

Eddy faints during the yoga class because the class — which he take for the first time —is too difficult for him. He needs to take a class for **beginners** so it will go slow.

> Corrections:

1. “which he take” → verb tense error → should be takes
2. “bigneers” → typo → should be beginners
3. “go slow” → adverb needed → should be go more slowly (or simply “be slower”)

**Do you enjoy doing yoga? Why or why not?**

> Corrections:

I enjoy doing yoga. It makes me relaxed and it's good for my health.

I used to enjoy doing yoga. It ~~makes~~ me feel relaxed. But now I prefer doing other exercises.

> Corrections:

1. Since you said “used to enjoy,” it’s clearer to use past tense made me feel relaxed (for consistency with the past habit).

I used to enjoy doing yoga. It **made** me feel relaxed. But now I prefer doing other exercises.

我以前喜欢练瑜伽。它让我感到放松。但现在我更喜欢做其他运动。

Yes, I enjoyed doing yoga years ago, but I quit doing it now. Yoga helps us relax, but now I just want to do other exercise like swimming.

> Corrections:

1. “Yes, I enjoyed doing yoga years ago, but I quit doing it now.” → 时态对比不自然，建议将后半句改为过去时或现在完成时：“but I’ve stopped doing it.”
2. “Yoga helps us relax” → 虽然语法正确，但和上下文不够连贯，可改为“helped me relax”
3. “do other exercise like swimming” → “exercise” 是不可数名词，前面不能加 “other”，应为 “do other forms of exercise” 或 “do other activities”

Yes, I **used to** enjoy doing yoga a few years ago, but **I’ve stopped** doing it now. It really helped me relax, both **physically** and **mentally**. These days, I prefer doing other **forms of exercise**, like swimming.

是的，我几年前很喜欢做瑜伽，但现在已经不练了。它曾经确实帮我放松身心。不过现在我更喜欢做其他类型的运动，比如游泳。

### **Describe a physical activity you used to do but no longer do**

_You should say:_
– what the activity was
– when and where you did it
– why you stopped doing it
and explain how you feel about it now

One physical activity I **used to do regularly** was yoga. I started practicing it about five or six years ago when I was in college. There was a small yoga studio near my campus, and I joined a beginner-level class with some of my friends.

At the time, I really enjoyed it. It helped me relax both **physically and mentally**. I especially liked the peaceful atmosphere and the focus on breathing and mindfulness. After a long day of studying, doing yoga in the evening made me feel calm and refreshed.

However, after I graduated and started working, my schedule changed and I found it hard to keep up with yoga. Eventually, I stopped going to classes. Also, **my interest shifted toward** other types of exercise, especially swimming. I like how dynamic and full-body swimming is — it makes me feel more active and **energized**.

**Looking back**, I still have positive feelings about yoga. It was a meaningful part of my life at the time, and **I might even take it up again** in the future if I have the time and space for it.

我以前经常做的一项运动是瑜伽。我大概是在五六年前大学期间开始练的。当时我和朋友们一起参加了校区附近一个初级班。

那段时间我真的很享受瑜伽的过程。它既能放松身体，也能平静心情。我尤其喜欢它安静的氛围和对呼吸、专注的强调。每天学习完后做一会儿瑜伽，真的让我感觉焕然一新。

但后来毕业开始工作后，我的作息发生了变化，也很难继续上课。渐渐地，我就停止了瑜伽的练习。而且，我的兴趣也转向了其他运动，尤其是游泳。我喜欢游泳那种全身性的锻炼和动感，它让我更有活力。

回头看，瑜伽仍然是我生活中很美好的一段经历。如果将来有时间和空间，我可能会重新开始练习。
