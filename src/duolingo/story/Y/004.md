# You Can Talk?

Lily just got home from her job at the clothing store.

- **Lily**: I’m so tired of **customers complaining** all day.

She sits down. Her dog jumps up on the sofa.

- **Dog**: Lily, we need to talk.
- **Lily**: What?!
- **Dog**: I don’t want dog food anymore. I want to eat **steak** every day.
- **Lily**: What is happening?
- **Dog**: And I want to sleep in your bed. You can sleep on my pillow.
- **Lily**: What? No!
- **Dog**: Do you want to sleep outside instead?
- **Lily**: You don’t even sleep outside!
- **Lily**: I think my job is giving me bad dreams!
