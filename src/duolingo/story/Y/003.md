# You Can't Rush Art - B2

As Oscar walks into his friend Vikram's bakery, Vikram gives him a hug.

- **Vikram**: Oscar, thanks for coming. My cake decorator is sick, and I need to deliver this cake tonight.
- **Oscar**: Of course. As an artist, I can make anything art, even a simple dessert!
- **Vikram**: Thank you! Could you please decorate this cake with a nature theme?
- **Oscar**: Don't worry. I'll come up with something brilliant.

An hour later, Vikram returns. Oscar is staring at the undecorated cake.

- **Vikram**: Uhh… Could you please get started soon?
- **Oscar**: I've already started. I'm waiting for inspiration.
- **Vikram**: Oh, of course!

An hour later, Vikram returns. There's **one spot of icing** on the cake.

- **Vikram**: Any chance you might work faster? We have to deliver the cake soon.
- **Oscar**: I can't work faster. But I've come up with a theme for the cake: **humanity**… and grass!
- **Vikram**: Wonderful! When will you be finished?
- **Oscar**: Who knows? You can't rush art.

Lin walks into the bakery.

- **Lin**: Vikram, I have to deliver the cake now. I'm already late for karaoke.
- **Vikram**: But I don't want to upset Oscar.
- **Lin**: You're being too polite. Oscar is taking too long!
- **Vikram**: Hey, Oscar, if it's not too much to ask, could you please hurry?
- **Oscar**: I told you, you can't rush art!
- **Vikram**: I agree… But if we're late, we'll miss the client's party. She's a very important client.
- **Oscar**: You want it finished?

Oscar angrily **squirts** lines of icing all over the cake.

- **Oscar**: There! It's done!

Oscar leaves, slamming the door.

- **Vikram**: We're out of time! The cake doesn't look finished, but could you deliver it anyway, Lin?
- **Lin**: Sure.

Later, Lin returns to the bakery.

- **Vikram**: Did they hate the cake?
- **Lin**: Actually, they loved how artistic and abstract it was. Everyone wants one exactly like it.
- **Vikram**: That's wonderful news!
  - Oh no, now all my cakes will have to be decorated by Oscar!

## Writing

### Would you buy a cake decorated by Oscar? Why or why not?

I'm not sure if I'll buy a cake decorated by Oscar. I don't care if it is decorated ~~by someone~~. But if the cake is too **expensive**, I probably don't buy it. All I **care about** are price, flavour, delivery speed. The decoration, if it's pretty, it is good. After all, if some ~~cake~~ really sells as goods, they will not be ugly.

I'm not sure if I'll buy a cake decorated by Oscar. I don't care **who** decorated it. But if the cake is too **expensive**, I probably won't buy it. All I **care about** are the price, flavor, and delivery speed. If the decoration is pretty, that's a **bonus**. After all, if a cake is really sold as a **product**, it shouldn't look ugly.

Not sure, I don't care if the cake is decorated by Oscar. But if the cake is too **expensive**, I probably **won't** buy it. All I **care about** **is** price, flavour, and delivery speed. The decoration, if it's pretty, **is** good. After all, if some cakes really are good, they will not be ugly.

> - “Not sure” is a fragment; it should be part of a complete sentence.
> - “All I care about **is** price, flavour, and delivery speed” – this is grammatically off because the subject is a list (plural), so it should be "**are**".
> - “The decoration, if it's pretty, is good” is understandable but could be smoother.
> - “If some cakes really are good, they will not be ugly” – a bit awkward and contradicts itself (a cake can taste good but look bad). You probably mean: if they are sold as real products, they should also look good.

I'm not sure. I don't care if the cake is decorated by Oscar. But if the cake is too **expensive**, I probably **won’t** buy it. All I **care about** **are** the price, flavour, and delivery speed. If the decoration is pretty, that's a **plus**. After all, if cakes are really sold as **products**, they shouldn’t look ugly.
