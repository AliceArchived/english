# And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.

就这样，我结识了小王子。

Once, when I was six years old, I saw a magnificent picture in a book called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest.
当我六岁的时候，在一本描写原始森林、名叫《真实的故事》的书中，看到了一幅精彩的插画。

It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
画的是一条蟒蛇正在吞食一只大野兽。这就是那幅画的摹本。

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
这本书中写道：“这些蟒蛇把它们的猎获物不加咀嚼地吞下。

After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
此后就不能再动弹了，它们就在长达六个月的睡眠中消化这些食物。”

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.
当时，我对丛林中的奇遇想得很多。

And after some work with a coloured pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.
于是，我用彩色铅笔努力画出了我的第一幅图画。

My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:
我的第一号作品，是这样的：

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
我把这幅杰作拿给大人看，问他们我的画是不是让他们感到害怕。

But they answered: "Frightened? Why should anyone be frightened by a hat?"
但他们回答说：“害怕？谁会害怕一顶帽子呢？”

My drawing was not a picture of a hat.
我画的并不是一顶帽子。

It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
那是一幅巨蟒正在消化一头大象的画。

But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing:
可由于大人们无法理解，我又画了另一幅图：

I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.
我把巨蟒肚子里的情形也画了出来，好让大人们看得清楚。

They always need to have things explained.
他们总是需要别人给他们解释。

My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
我的第二号作品是这样的：

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors—whether from the inside or the outside—and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar.
这一次，大人们的反应是劝我把那些画着巨蟒肚子里或肚子外的图画搁到一边，还是把精力放在地理、历史、算术和语法上面比较好。

That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
就这样，在我六岁那年，我放弃了可能成为一位杰出画家的美好前程。

I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.
我的第一号、第二号作品的失败，使我心灰意冷。

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
这些大人们靠自己什么也弄不懂，还得让孩子们不停地给他们解释，真是叫人厌烦。

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.
于是，我只好选择了另一个职业——我学会了开飞机。

I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.
我在世界各地飞行。的确，地理学对我帮助很大。

At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.
我一眼就能分辨出中国和亚利桑那。

If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
在夜间迷失方向时，这种知识很有用。

In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.
在我的生活中，我遇到过许多看重“重要事情”的人。

I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.
我长期生活在大人们中间。

I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
我近距离地仔细观察过他们，但这并没有使我对他们的看法好转多少。

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.
每当我遇到一个看起来头脑还算清楚的大人，我就会拿出我一直保存着的第一号作品来做个试验。

I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding.
我想借此看看他是不是一个真正懂得事理的人。

But, whoever it was, he or she would always say: "That is a hat."
可是谁都一样，他们总是说：“这是一顶帽子。”

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars.
于是我再也不会和那人谈起什么蟒蛇啦，原始森林啦，星星啦之类的事情。

I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties.
我只好放下身段，和他们谈些桥牌啦，高尔夫啦，政治啦，领带啦这些他们喜欢的话题。

And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
于是大人们就会很高兴，觉得认识了我这个“通情达理”的人。

So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.
就这样，我孤独地过着日子，找不到一个真正谈得来的人，直到六年前，我的飞机在撒哈拉沙漠出了故障。

Something was broken in my engine.
我的发动机出了点毛病。

And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.
由于我身边既没有机械师，也没有乘客，我只好独自一个人着手进行这项艰难的修理工作。

It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
这对我来说是个生死攸关的问题：我带的饮用水勉强只能维持一个星期。

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
就这样，第一个夜晚我就睡在沙地上，离任何人烟都远得有上千英里。

I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
我比大海中漂浮在木筏上的遇难水手还要孤独得多。

Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.
所以你可以想象，当太阳升起、一个奇怪的小声音把我叫醒时，我是多么吃惊。

It said: "If you please—draw me a sheep!"
那声音说：“请你……给我画一只羊吧！”

"What!"
“啊？！”

"Draw me a sheep!"
“给我画一只羊！”

I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.
我像被雷击中了一样，猛地跳了起来。

I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me.
我使劲地眨了眨眼睛，仔细环顾四周。

And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.
我看到一个十分奇特的小家伙，正一本正经地站在那里，目不转睛地打量着我。

Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.
下面这幅画像，是我后来画出的他最像的一幅。

But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
不过，我的画当然远远没有他本人那样迷人。

That, however, is not my fault.
但这并不是我的错。

The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
六岁那年，大人们让我对当画家的志向彻底丧失了信心，从那以后我再也没学过画画，除了画开着肚皮的蟒蛇和闭着肚皮的蟒蛇之外。

Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment.
这时我惊奇地瞪大了眼睛，望着这个突然出现的小家伙，简直两眼都要掉出来了。

Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.
别忘了，我是在远离人烟上千英里的沙漠中失事的。

And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.
可这个小家伙看起来既不像是在沙漠中迷了路，也没有任何疲惫、饥饿、口渴或恐惧的样子。

Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
他身上丝毫没有表现出一个迷失在杳无人烟的大沙漠中的孩子该有的模样。

When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But—what are you doing here?"
等我终于能够开口时，我问他：“可是——你怎么会在这里？”

And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please—draw me a sheep..."
他回答得很慢，好像是在谈一件极其重要的事：“请你……给我画一只羊……”

When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.
当一种神秘的力量让你震撼不已时，你是不敢不服从它的。

Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen.
尽管这一行为看起来十分荒诞——我身处荒无人烟、性命堪忧的沙漠中——我还是从口袋里掏出了一张纸和一支钢笔。

But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.
但我随即想起，我只学过地理、历史、算术和语法，于是有些不耐烦地对这个小家伙说，我不会画画。

He answered me: "That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."
他回答我说：“没关系，给我画一只羊吧……”

But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.
可是我从来没有画过羊，于是我就照老样子，画了我画得最多的两幅图之一。

It was that of a boa constrictor from the outside.
那就是那幅画着闭着肚皮的巨蟒的图。

And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
听到小家伙的反应，我简直惊呆了。他说：“不，不，不！我不要一头在蟒蛇肚子里的大象。

A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
巨蟒太危险了，大象也太占地方。

Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."
我住的地方非常小。我需要的是一只羊——给我画一只羊吧。”

So then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said:
于是我就画了一只。他认真地看了一会儿，然后说：

"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
“不行，这只羊看起来病恹恹的。给我再画一只。”

So I made another drawing.
于是我又画了一幅。

My friend smiled gently and indulgently.
我的这位朋友温柔而宽容地笑了笑。

"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
他说道：“你看，这不是羊，是只公羊。它长着犄角呢。”

So then I did my drawing over once more. But it was rejected too, just like the others.
于是我又重新画了一张。但和前几幅一样，这一张也被他否决了。

"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
“这只太老了。我想要一只能活得久一点的羊。”

By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart.
这时候，我的耐心已经耗尽了——我还急着去拆发动机修理呢。

So I tossed off this drawing. And I threw out an explanation with it.
于是我就随手画了这张画，并附带解释说：

"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
“这只是一个箱子，你要的羊就在里面。”

I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
让我惊讶的是，这位小评审的脸上立刻露出了光彩：

"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
“这正是我想要的！你觉得这只羊会不会需要很多草？”

"Why?" "Because where I live everything is very small..."
“为什么这样问？” “因为我住的地方，所有东西都非常小……”

"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
“那肯定够它吃的，”我说，“我给你的这只羊很小很小。”

He bent his head over the drawing: "Not so small that—Look! He has gone to sleep..."
他把头低到画前：“可它也没小到那种程度……瞧！它睡着了……”

And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
就这样，我结识了小王子。
