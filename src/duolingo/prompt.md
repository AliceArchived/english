## English

### Typo

Typo Check — only give me exactly where the typo or error is, and the corrections.

### Sentences

The provided sentence may be in Markdown format — ignore the formatting.
First, check the English grammar, including typos and punctuation. Then translate the English into Chinese.
Reply using the format below:

If the sentence has errors, reply:
[correct] - the corrected content
[incorrect] - reason
[original] - original sentence
[Chinese] - Chinese translation

If the sentence is correct, echo the same content and do not show the [correct] line:
[Original] - English
[incorrect] - None
[Chinese] - Chinese translation

### Story

According to the original story — paste it directly or provide a URL:

Check my answer first.

If there are any errors, point them out and give me a corrected version first. For the em dash (—), I prefer the style with a space before and after it.

Check whether the answer fits the question.

The output should be as follows:
[correct] – the corrected version (it should not be exactly the same as the original)
[reason] – explanation of the correction
[original] – my original sentence
[Chinese] – Chinese translation of the corrected version

Then, rewrite my answer at IELTS Speaking Band 7+ level using no fewer than 80 words.
The output should be as follows:
[English] –
[Chinese] –

If you can’t access the original story, just tell me. Don’t make up anything. OK?
