# Lesson 1 A Puma at large

## Context

**Listen to the tape then answer the question below.**

**Where must the puma have come from?**

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

## 参考译文

逃遁的美洲狮

美洲狮是体型较大的猫科动物，分布于美洲。当伦敦动物园收到报告称，在伦敦以南四十五英里处发现了一只野生美洲狮时，他们并未认真对待。然而，随着证据逐渐累积，动物园的专家感到有义务展开调查，因为那些声称目击美洲狮的人提供的描述出奇地相似。

对美洲狮的追捕始于一个小村庄，一位正在采黑莓的妇女在离她只有五码远的地方看到了一只“大猫”。当她看到它时，它立刻跑开了，专家确认，美洲狮除非被逼到绝境，不会攻击人类。搜寻工作十分困难，因为这只美洲狮常在早上出现在某地，晚上却又出现在二十英里外的另一个地方。无论它去哪里，都会留下被杀死的鹿和像兔子这样的小动物的踪迹。许多地方发现了爪印，还有美洲狮的毛粘在灌木丛上。几位居民抱怨夜晚听到“猫叫般的声音”，还有一位出钓的商人看到那只美洲狮爬在树上。专家们现在完全相信那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪里来的呢？由于全国各地动物园都没有报告美洲狮失踪，这只美洲狮一定是某个私人收藏者所养，之后设法逃脱了。追捕持续了好几个星期，但这只美洲狮始终没有被捉住。想到一只危险的野生动物仍然在宁静的乡村游荡，确实令人不安。
