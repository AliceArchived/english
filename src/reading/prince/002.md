- [《小王子》全集 (上) ](https://youtu.be/StNJHi5b2oM)

It took me a long time to learn where he came from.
我花了很长时间，才弄清楚他到底是从哪里来的。

The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him.
这个向我提出了那么多问题的小王子，却似乎从来没听见我问他的问题。

It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.
是他在无意间说漏的一些话，才让我一点一点拼凑出他的来历。

The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: "What is that object?"
比如，他第一次看到我的飞机时（我就不画我的飞机了，因为对我来说那实在太复杂），他问我：“那是什么东西？”

"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
“那可不是‘东西’。它会飞。那是飞机，是我的飞机。”

And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.
我很骄傲地让他知道，我是会飞的。

He cried out, then: "What! You dropped down from the sky?"
他惊叫道：“什么？你是从天上掉下来的？”

"Yes," I answered, **modestly**.
“是的。”我谦虚地回答道。

"Oh! That is funny!"
“啊？这真好笑！”

And the little prince broke into a lovely **peal** of **laughter**, which irritated me very much.
小王子随即发出一阵清脆悦耳的笑声，这让我非常恼火。

I like my **misfortunes** to be taken seriously.
我希望别人能严肃对待我的不幸。

Then he added: "So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
接着他又说：“那么，你也是从天上来的啦！你是哪个星球上的？”

At that moment I caught a **gleam** of light in the **impenetrable** mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: "Do you come from another planet?"
就在那一刻，我仿佛在他身上那层无法揭开的神秘面纱中捕捉到了一丝光亮；于是我突然问道：“你是从另一个星球来的吗？”

But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:
可他没有回答。他轻轻摇了摇头，依然目不转睛地盯着我的飞机看：

"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away…"
“可不是嘛，靠这个玩意儿，你不可能是从很远的地方来的……”

And he sank into a **reverie**, which lasted a long time.
说完这句话，他就陷入了长时间的沉思。

Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the **contemplation** of his treasure.
接着，他从口袋里掏出我画的小羊，沉醉地凝视着他的宝贝。

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the 'other planets.'
你可以想象，这种关于“别的星球”模模糊糊的暗示，引起我多么强烈的好奇心。

I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
于是我拼命想要从他口中打探出更多的秘密。

"My little man, where do you come from?
“你是从哪里来的，我的小家伙？

What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak?"
你说的‘我住的地方’，到底是哪里啊？”

"Where do you want to take your sheep?"
“你打算把你的小羊带到哪里去呢？”

After a reflective silence he answered: "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."
他沉思了一会儿，然后回答我说：“你给我的那个箱子真好，晚上它可以当作小羊的房子。”

"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."
“那当然。如果你乖的话，我还可以给你画一根绳子，这样白天你就能把它拴住，再画一根桩子给你栓它。”

But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: "Tie him! What a **queer** idea!"
可小王子听了这话却像是受了惊：“拴住他！多么奇怪的主意！”

"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
“可如果你不拴住他，”我说，“他就会到处乱跑，然后走丢了。”

My friend broke into another peal of laughter: "But where do you think he would go?"
我的小朋友又笑了起来：“你以为他能跑到哪里去呀？”

"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."
“哪儿都行，他会一直往前走。”

Then the little prince said, **earnestly**: "That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
小王子却郑重其事地说：“那没关系，我住的地方，所有东西都非常小。”

And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far…"
接着，他略带一丝伤感地补充道：“一直往前走，是走不了多远的……”

## Sentences

### demanded

At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: "Do you come from another planet?"

就在那一刻，我仿佛在他身上那层无法揭开的神秘面纱中捕捉到了一丝光亮；于是我突然问道：“你是从另一个星球来的吗？”

Explanation of "demanded":
In this sentence, "demanded" does not imply a forceful or angry command, as it might in other contexts. Instead, it emphasizes the urgency or intensity of the speaker’s curiosity or need for an answer. It means the speaker asked the question with sudden intensity, insistence, or emotional pressure, rather than casually.

This tone is reinforced by the adverb "abruptly", showing that the question broke out unexpectedly, likely due to the moment's emotional or mysterious intensity.

So here, **"demanded" = asked insistently and urgently.**

### buried himself in…

Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
接着，他从口袋里掏出我画的小羊，沉醉地凝视着他的宝贝。

- "buried himself in…" is a figurative expression meaning he became completely absorbed or deeply engaged in something, as if shutting out the rest of the world.
- "contemplation" means deep, focused, and thoughtful observation or reflection.

So, "buried himself in the contemplation" means he was entirely lost in thought while looking at or thinking about his "treasure" (the drawing of the sheep), as if it were the only thing that mattered in that moment.

In Chinese, this is well captured by “沉醉地凝视” — it implies total focus and emotional attachment.

### half-confidence

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the 'other planets.'
你可以想象，这种关于“别的星球”模模糊糊的暗示，引起我多么强烈的好奇心。

"half-confidence":

- "confidence" here means something confided — a secret or private piece of information someone shares.
- "half-confidence" means it was only partially revealed, not fully explained, or just hinted at, like a vague or incomplete confession.

So in this sentence, the speaker refers to the boy’s mention of “other planets” as an unclear or partial disclosure, which piqued their curiosity even more because it left so much unexplained.

In Chinese, “模模糊糊的暗示” is a great translation — it conveys that sense of mystery and partial revelation perfectly.

### reflective silence

After a reflective silence he answered: "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."
他沉思了一会儿，然后回答我说：“你给我的那个箱子真好，晚上它可以当作小羊的房子。”

"reflective silence":

- "reflective" means thoughtful, meditative, or deeply considering something.
- "reflective silence" refers to a pause during which someone is quietly thinking — not just silent, but silently thinking deeply.

So, "after a reflective silence" means after spending a quiet moment lost in thought, he finally gave his answer. It implies that the response was considered and meaningful, not just impulsive.

In Chinese，“沉思了一会儿”正好表达了这个意思 — 强调他是在思考、不是沉默无语。
