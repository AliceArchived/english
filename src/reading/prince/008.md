# Chapter 08 - IX

I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds.
我想小王子是利用一群候乌迁徒的机会跑出来的。
On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order.
在他出发的那天早上，他把他的星球收拾得整整齐齐。
He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes
他小心翼翼地把它上头的活火山打扫得干干净净。
He possessed two active volcanoes; they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning.
他有两个活火山，早上热他的早点很方便。
He also had one volcano that was extinct.
他还有一座死火山。

But, as he said, " One never knows! " So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.
他想，谁也说不定会发生什么！所以他把它这座死火山也打扫干净了。
If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions.
如同都被打扫干净了，火山们就可以慢慢地有规律地燃烧，而不会突然爆发。
Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
火山爆发就象烟囱里的火焰一样。
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes.
当然，在我们地球上我们人显然太小了而没法打扫火山。
That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.
所以它们不停地给我们带来很多麻烦。

The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs.
小王子带着一些沮丧还把最后剩下的几颗猴面包树嫩苗全拔了。
He believed that he would never want to return.
他坚信他再也不会想回来了。
But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him.
但是在最后一天的早上，所有这些习以为常的活儿使他感到特别珍贵。
And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
当他最后一次浇花时，准备把她放在玻璃球罩中好好珍藏起来。他发觉自己快要哭出来了。
" Goodbye," he said to the flower. But she made no answer. " Goodbye, " he said again.
“再见了。”他对花儿说道。可是她没有回答。“再见了。”他又说了一遍。

The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
花儿咳嗽了一下。但这并不是由于她感冒了。
' I have been silly, " she said to him, at last. " I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."
她终于对他说道：“我一直都太蠢了。请你原谅我。希望你能够幸福…….
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
他对这种毫不抱怨（的话语）感到很惊讶。他不知所措地伫立在那里，将玻璃球罩举在空中。
他不明白如此的温柔恬静。
"Of course I love you, " the flower said to him.
“我当然是爱你的。”花儿对他说道。
" It is my fault that you have not known it all the while.
“但由于我的过错，你一点也没有发觉。

That is of no importance.
这丝毫不重要。
But you-- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy...
不过，你也和我一样的蠢。努力让自己幸福 ⋯⋯
let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."
把罩子放在一边吧，我再也不想用它了。
" But the wind--"
“要是风.…
" My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."
“我的感冒并不那么重…夜晚的凉风对我倒有好处。我是一朵花。

"But the animals--"
“但是野兽呢？……”
" Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.
“我要是想认识蝴蝶，就必须忍受两三只毛毛虫。
It seems that they are very beautiful.
据说这是很美的。
And if not the butterflies-- and the caterpillars-- who will call upon me?
若不是蝴蝶和毛毛虫，还有谁会来看我呢？
You will be far away…. as for the large animals-- I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
你就要到远方去了……至于说大动物，我并不怕，我有自己的爪子。”

And, naively, she showed her four thorns.
于是，她天真地露出她的四根刺。
Then she added: " Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go! "
随后她又说：“别磨蹭了。你既然决定离开这儿，现在就走吧！”
For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...
因为她不想让他看见她哭泣。她是一朵非常骄傲的花……

He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325,326,327,328,329, and 330.
他发现自己的周围还有 325、326、327、328、329、330 等几颗小行星。
He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.
因此他就开始访问它们，以增长知识。
The first of them was inhabited by a king.
第一颗星球上住着一个国王。
Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.
他穿着蓝紫色的貂皮（长袍），坐在一个很简单却又十分威严的宝座上。
"Ah! Here is a subject, " exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
当他看见小王子时，喊了起来：“啊，来了一个臣民。”

And the little prince asked himself: " How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before? "
小王子思量着：“他从来也没有见过我，怎么会认识我呢？”
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.
他哪里知道，在那些国王们的眼里，世界是非常简单的：对于他们来说，所有的人都是臣民。
" Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
国王十分骄傲，因为他终于成了某个人的国王，他对小王子说道：“靠近些，好让我好好看看
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe.
小王子看看四周，想找个地方坐下来，可是整个星球被国王华丽的貂皮长袍占满了。

So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
他只好继续站着，但是因为疲倦了，他打起哈欠来。
"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him.
"I forbid you to do so."
君王对他说：“在一个国王面前打哈欠是违反礼节的。我禁止你打哈欠。”
"I can't help it. I can't stop myself, " replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed.
小王子十分羞愧地说道：“我实在忍不住，我无法制止我自己。
" I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep.
我长途跋涉来到这里，还没有睡觉呢。
"Ah, then, " the king said. " I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning.
国王说：“那好吧，我命令你打哈欠。好些年来我都没有看见过任何人打哈欠了。

Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity.
对我来说，打哈欠倒是新奇的事。
Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."
来吧，现在！再打个哈欠！这是命令。”
" That frightens me... I cannot, any more.." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
“这倒是吓到我了….我打不出哈欠来了…”小王子红着脸嘟囔说。
"Hum! Hum!" replied the king." Then I-- I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--"
“嗯！嗯！”国王回答道：“那么我.…•命令你忽而打哈欠，忽而…”
He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.
他嘟嘟囔囔，显出有点恼怒。

For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected
因为国王所坚持的主要是保持他的威严受到尊敬。
He tolerated no disobedience.
他不能容忍违抗命令。
He was an absolute monarch.
他是一位专制的君主。
But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.
可是因为他很善良，他下的命令都是合理的。

"If l ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
他常常说：“如果我叫一位将军变成一只海鸟，而这位将军不服从我的命令，那么这就不是将军的过错，而是我的过错。”
" May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
小王子腼腆地试探道：“我可以坐下吗？
"I order you to do so," the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.
“我命令你坐下。”国王一边回答，一边庄重地把他那貂皮大襟收拢折叠了一下。
But the little prince was wondering..
可是小王子感到很奇怪。

The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?
这么小的行星，国王他对什么进行统治呢？
" Sire," he said to him, " I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question--"
他对国王说：“陛下…请原谅，我想问您……
"I order you to ask me a question, " the king hastened to assure him.
国王急忙抢着说道：“我命令你问我问题。”
" Sire-- over what do you rule?"
“陛下…你统治什么呢？”
" Over everything," said the king, with magnificent simplicity.
国王非常简单明宁地说：“我统治一切。"

"Over everything?"
“一切？”
The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.
国王轻轻地用手指着他的行星和其他的行星，以及所有的星星。
"Over all that? " asked the little prince.
小王子说：“统治这一切？”
" Over all that, " the king answered.
“统治这一切。”
For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
原来他不仅是一个绝对的君主，而且是整个宇宙的君主。
